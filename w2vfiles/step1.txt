Irish Civil War Irish: Cogadh Cathartha hÉireann; 1922 1923 conflict followed Irish War Independence accompanied establishment Irish Free State, entity independent United Kingdom within British Empire. civil war waged two opposing groups, Irish republicans Irish nationalists, Anglo-Irish Treaty. forces Provisional Government became Free State 1922 supported Treaty, Republican opposition saw betrayal Irish Republic proclaimed during Easter Rising. fought conflict members Irish Republican Army IRA during War Independence. Civil War won Free State forces, heavily armed weapons provided British Government, transported Royal Navy. conflict claimed lives War Independence preceded it, left Irish society divided embittered generations. Today, two main political parties Republic Ireland, Fianna Fáil Fine Gael, direct descendants opposing sides war. Anglo-Irish Treaty agreed end 1919–1921 Irish War Independence Irish Republic United Kingdom Great Britain Ireland. treaty provided self-governing Irish state, having its own army police. Treaty allowed Northern Ireland six north-eastern counties Fermanagh, Antrim, Tyrone, Londonderry, Armagh Down majority population Protestant religion opt new state return United Kingdom immediately. However, rather creating independent republic favoured nationalists, Irish Free State autonomous dominion British Empire British monarch head state, manner Canada Australia. British suggested dominion secret correspondence even treaty negotiations began, Sinn Féin leader Éamon Valera rejected dominion. treaty stipulated members new Irish Oireachtas parliament following "Oath Allegiance" I... solemnly swear true faith allegiance Constitution Irish Free State law established, will faithful Majesty King George heirs successors law virtue common citizenship Ireland Great Britain adherence membership group nations forming British Commonwealth nations. oath highly objectionable Irish Republicans. Furthermore, partition Ireland, already decided Westminster parliament Government Ireland Act 1920, effectively confirmed Anglo-Irish treaty. contentious areas Treaty IRA disestablishment Irish Republic declared 1919, abandonment First Dáil, status Irish Free State dominion British Commonwealth British retention so-called strategic Treaty Ports Ireland's south coast remain occupied Royal Navy. issues cause split IRA ultimately civil war. Michael Collins, republican leader led Irish negotiating team, argued treaty gave "not ultimate freedom nations aspire develop, freedom achieve freedom". However, anti-treaty militants 1922 believed treaty deliver full Irish independence. split treaty deeply personal. leaders sides close friends comrades during War Independence. made disagreement treaty bitter. Michael Collins later Éamon Valera sent plenipotentiary negotiate treaty knew British not concede independent Irish republic wanted Collins blame compromise settlement. felt deeply betrayed when Valera refused stand agreement plenipotentiaries negotiated David Lloyd George Winston Churchill. Valera, part, furious Collins Arthur Griffith signed treaty without consulting Irish cabinet instructed. Dáil Éireann parliament Irish Republic narrowly passed Anglo-Irish Treaty votes 1922. Following Treaty's ratification, accordance article Treaty, British-recognised Provisional Government Irish Free State established. Its authority Treaty provide "provisional arrangement administration Southern Ireland during interval" establishment Irish Free State. accordance Treaty, British Government transferred "the powers machinery requisite discharge its duties". British Government transferred powers, members Provisional Government "signified writing [their] acceptance [the Treaty]". Upon Treaty's ratification, Valera resigned President Republic failed re-elected even closer vote 60–58. challenged right Dáil approve treaty, saying its members breaking oath Irish Republic. Valera continued promote compromise whereby new Irish Free State "external association" British Commonwealth rather member inclusion republics within Commonwealth Nations not formally implemented until 1949. early March, formed "Cumann Poblachta" Republican Association party remaining member Sinn Féin commenced speaking tour republican province Munster 1922. During tour, Valera made controversial speeches Carrick Suir, Lismore, Dungarvan Waterford, saying one point, "If Treaty accepted, fight freedom on, Irish people, instead fighting foreign soldiers, will fight Irish soldiers Irish government set Irishmen." Thurles, several days later, repeated imagery added IRA "would wade blood soldiers Irish Government, perhaps members Irish Government freedom." letter Irish Independent March, Valera accepted accuracy report comment "wading" blood, deplored newspaper published it. seriously, Irish Republican Army IRA officers against treaty, 1922 hoc Army Convention repudiated authority Dáil accept treaty. contrast, Minister Defence, Richard Mulcahy, stated Dáil conditions Dublin prevented Convention held, delegates selected voted ballot accept Oath. anti-Treaty IRA formed own "Army Executive", declared real government country, despite result 1921 general election. April, Minister Defence, Richard Mulcahy, summarised alleged illegal activities IRA men previous three months, whom described 'seceding volunteers', including hundreds robberies. Yet fragmenting army police force ground following disintegration Irish Republican Police disbanding Royal Irish Constabulary RIC. putting ten questions General Mulcahy April, Seán McEntee argued Army Executive acted continuously its own create republic 1917, unaltered constitution, fallen control Dáil, that: "the body competent dissolve Volunteer Executive duly convened convention Irish Republican Army" not Dáil. accepting treaty abandoning republic, Dáil majority effectively deserted Army Executive. reply, Mulcahy rejected interpretation. Then, debate defence, McEntee suggested supporting Army Executive "... even meant scrapping Treaty terrible immediate war England, better civil war beginning present apparently." McEntee's supporters added robberies complained Mulcahy caused lack payment provision Dáil volunteers. Collins established "army re-unification committee" re-unite IRA organised election pact Valera's anti-treaty political followers campaign jointly Free State's first election 1922 form coalition government afterwards. tried reach compromise anti-treaty IRA leaders agreeing republican-type constitution mention British monarchy new state. IRA leaders Liam Lynch prepared accept compromise. However, proposal republican constitution vetoed British contrary terms treaty threatened military intervention Free State unless treaty fully implemented. Collins reluctantly agreed. completely undermined electoral pact pro- anti-treaty factions, went Irish general election 1922 hostile parties, calling themselves Sinn Féin. Pro-Treaty Sinn Féin party won election 239,193 votes 133,864 Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin. further 247,226 people voted parties, whom supported Treaty. Labour's 132,570 votes ambiguous regard Treaty. According Hopkinson, "Irish labour union leaders, generally pro-Treaty, made little attempt lead opinion during Treaty conflict, casting themselves rather attempted peacemakers." election showed majority Irish electorate accepted treaty foundation Irish Free State, Valera, political followers IRA continued oppose treaty. Valera quoted saying, "the majority right wrong". Meanwhile, leadership Michael Collins Arthur Griffith, pro-treaty Provisional Government set establishing Irish Free State, organised National Army replace IRA new police force. However, envisaged new army built around IRA, Anti-Treaty IRA units allowed British barracks arms. practice, meant summer 1922, Provisional Government Southern Ireland controlled Dublin areas County Longford IRA units supported treaty. Fighting ultimately broke when Provisional Government tried assert its authority well-armed intransigent Anti-Treaty IRA units around country particularly hardline group Dublin. 1922, 200 Anti-Treaty IRA militants, led Rory O'Connor, occupied Four Courts several buildings central Dublin, resulting tense stand-off. anti-treaty Republicans wanted spark new armed confrontation British, hoped unite two factions IRA against common enemy. However, determined Free State viable, self-governing Irish state, act rebellion put down rather British. Arthur Griffith favour using force against men immediately, Michael Collins, wanted costs avoid civil war, left Four Courts garrison alone until late 1922. point, Pro-Treaty Sinn Féin party secured large majority general election, along parties supported Treaty. Collins coming continuing pressure London assert government's authority capital. British lost patience result action secretly ordered Collins. Henry Hughes Wilson, retired British Army field marshal prominent security adviser Prime Minister Northern Ireland James Craig, assassinated London role Northern Ireland. Winston Churchill assumed Anti-Treaty IRA responsible killing warned Collins use British troops attack Four Courts unless Provisional Government took action. fact, British cabinet actually resolved attack Four Courts themselves June, operation involved tanks, howitzers aeroplanes. However, advice General Nevil Macready, commanded British garrison Dublin, plan cancelled last minute. Macready's argument British involvement united Irish Nationalist opinion against treaty, instead Collins given last chance clear Four Courts himself. final straw Free State government June, when Four Courts republican garrison kidnapped "Ginger" O'Connell, general new National Army. Collins, giving Four Courts garrison final ultimatum leave building June, decided end stand-off bombarding Four Courts garrison surrender. government appointed Collins Commander-in-Chief National Army. attack not opening shot war, skirmishes taken place pro- anti-treaty IRA factions throughout country when British handing barracks. However, represented 'point return', when all-out war ipso facto declared Civil War began. Collins ordered Mulcahy accept British offer two 18-pdr field artillery use new army Free State, though General Macready gave just 200 shells 10,000 store Richmond barracks Inchicore. anti-treaty forces Four Courts, possessed small arms, surrendered two days bombardment storming building Provisional Government troops 28–30 1922. Shortly surrender, massive explosion destroyed western wing complex, including Irish Public Record Office PRO, injuring advancing Free State soldiers destroying records. Government supporters alleged building deliberately mined. Historians dispute whether PRO intentionally destroyed mines laid Republicans evacuation explosions occurred when ammunition store accidentally ignited bombardment. Pitched battles continued Dublin until July, Anti-Treaty IRA units Dublin Brigade, led Oscar Traynor, occupied O'Connell Street provoking week's street fighting: costing sides killed 280 wounded. Among dead Republican leader Cathal Brugha, made last stand exiting Granville Hotel. addition, Free State took 500 Republican prisoners. civilian casualties estimated numbered 250. When fighting Dublin died down, Free State government left firmly control Irish capital anti-treaty forces dispersed around country, mainly south west. outbreak Civil War forced pro- anti-treaty supporters choose sides. Supporters treaty known "pro-treaty" Free State Army, legally National Army, often called "Staters" opponents. latter called themselves Republicans known "anti-treaty" forces, Irregulars, term preferred Free State side. Anti-Treaty IRA claimed defending Irish Republic declared 1916 during Easter Rising, confirmed First Dáil invalidly set aside accepted compromise Free State. Éamon Valera stated serve ordinary IRA volunteer left leadership Anti-Treaty Republicans Liam Lynch, IRA Chief Staff. Valera, though Republican 'President 1922, little control military operations. Military operations directed Liam Lynch until killed 1923 Frank Aiken, 1923. Civil War split IRA. When Civil War broke out, Anti-Treaty IRA concentrated south west outnumbered pro-Free State forces roughly 12,000 men 8,000. Moreover, Anti-Treaty ranks included IRA's experienced guerrilla fighters. paper strength IRA early 1922 72,000 men, recruited during truce British fought neither War Independence nor Civil War. According Richard Mulcahy's estimate anti-Treaty IRA beginning war, 6,780 rifles 12,900 men. However, Anti-Treaty IRA lacked effective command structure, clear strategy sufficient arms. rifles handful machine guns fighters armed shotguns handguns. took handful armoured cars British troops evacuating country. Finally, artillery kind. result, forced adopt defensive stance throughout war. contrast, Free State government managed expand its forces dramatically start war. Michael Collins commanders able build army able overwhelm opponents field. British supplies artillery, aircraft, armoured cars, machine guns, small arms, ammunition help pro-treaty forces. British delivered instance, 27,000 rifles, 250 machine guns eight pounder artillery pieces pro-Treaty forces outbreak Civil War 1922. National Army amounted 14,000 men 1922, 38,000 strong end 1922, end war grown 55,000 men 3,500 officers, far excess Irish state need maintain peacetime. anti-Treaty IRA, Free State's National Army initially rooted IRA fought against British.

Sporadic fighting took place around Dundalk, Frank Aiken Fourth Northern Division Irish Republican Army based, Dublin, small-scale regular attacks mounted Free State troops. 1922 saw widespread attacks Free State forces territories occupied July–August offensive, inflicting heavy casualties them. Commander-in-Chief Michael Collins killed ambush anti-treaty Republicans Béal mBláth, near home County Cork, 1922. Collins' death increased bitterness Free State leadership towards Republicans probably contributed subsequent descent conflict cycle atrocities reprisals. Arthur Griffith, Free State president, died brain haemorrhage ten days before, leaving Free State government hands Cosgrave Free State army command General Richard Mulcahy. brief period, rising casualties among its troops its two principal leaders dead, looked Free State collapse. However, winter set in, republicans found increasingly difficult sustain campaign, casualty rates among National Army troops dropped rapidly. instance, County Sligo, people died conflict, whom eight killed end September. autumn winter 1922, Free State forces broke larger Republican guerrilla units Sligo, Meath, Connemara west, example, Dublin city. Elsewhere, Anti-Treaty units forced lack supplies safe-houses disperse smaller groups, typically nine ten men.

However, anti-treaty side held significant territory Valera's "government" authority population. case, IRA leaders paid attention it, seeing Republican authority vested own military leaders. 1922, three months outbreak war, Free State's Provisional Government put Dáil Army Emergency Powers Resolution proposing legislation setting military tribunals, transferring Free State's judicial powers Irish citizens accused anti-government activities Army Council. instituting martial law, first democratically elected Free State effect suspended most, not civil rights Irish population duration conflict. legislation, commonly referred Public Safety Bill, empowered military tribunals ability impose life imprisonment, death penalty, variety offences. allowing appointed courts martial execute Irish citizen found possession firearms ammunition, Free State prevented Republican sympathizers storing arms ammunition used Republican forces; possession even single sporting civilian firearm round ammunition result execution firing squad. Offenses included attacks state policy military forces, donning army police uniforms, publication "seditious publications", membership Republican Army. final phase Civil War degenerated series atrocities left lasting legacy bitterness Irish politics. Free State began executing Republican prisoners 1922, when five IRA men shot firing squad. followed execution acclaimed author treaty negotiator Robert Erskine Childers. all, Free State sanctioned official executions anti-treaty prisoners during Civil War. Anti-Treaty IRA reprisal assassinated Seán Hales. 1922, day Hales' killing, four prominent Republicans one province, held first week war—Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett Joe McKelvey executed revenge killing Hales. addition, Free State troops, particularly County Kerry, guerrilla campaign bitter, began summary execution captured anti-treaty fighters. notorious example occurred Ballyseedy, nine Republican prisoners tied landmine, detonated, killing eight leaving one, Stephen Fuller, blown clear blast, escape. number "unauthorised" executions Republican prisoners during war put high 153. Among Republican reprisals assassination Kevin O'Higgins' father Cosgrave's uncle 1923. Anti-Treaty IRA unable maintain effective guerrilla campaign, given gradual loss support. Catholic Church supported Free State, deeming lawful government country, denouncing Anti-Treaty IRA refusing administer Sacraments anti-treaty fighters. 1922, Catholic Bishops Ireland issued formal statement, describing anti-treaty campaign as: [A] system murder assassination National forces without legitimate authority... guerrilla warfare carried [by] Irregulars without moral sanction therefore killing National soldiers murder God, seizing public private property robbery, breaking roads, bridges railways criminal. contravention teaching, participate crimes guilty grievous sins not absolved Confession nor admitted Holy Communion persist evil courses. Churchmen appalled ruthlessness cruelty. Church's support Free State aroused bitter hostility among republicans. Although Catholic Church independent Ireland often seen triumphalist Church, recent study found felt deeply insecure events. early 1923, offensive capability Anti-Treaty IRA seriously eroded when, 1923, Republican leader Liam Deasy captured Free State forces, called republicans end campaign reach accommodation Free State. State's executions Anti-Treaty prisoners, whom shot 1923, took its toll Republicans' morale. addition, National Army's operations field slowly steadily breaking remaining Republican concentrations. 1923 saw progressive dismemberment Republican forces continue capture sometimes killing guerrilla columns. National Army report stated, "Events last few days point beginning end far irregular campaign concerned". conflict petered facto victory pro-treaty side, Valera asked IRA leadership call ceasefire, refused. Anti-Treaty IRA executive met County Tipperary discuss war's future. Tom Barry proposed motion end war, defeated votes Éamon Valera allowed attend, debate, given voting rights. Liam Lynch, Republican leader, killed skirmish Knockmealdown Mountains County Tipperary April. National Army extracted information Republican prisoners Dublin IRA Executive area killing Lynch, captured senior Anti-Treaty IRA officers Dan Breen, Todd Andrews, Seán Gaynor Frank Barrett operation. often suggested death Lynch allowed pragmatic Frank Aiken, took IRA Chief Staff, call halt seemed futile struggle. Aiken's accession IRA leadership followed declaration ceasefire behalf anti-treaty forces. 1923, Aiken followed order IRA volunteers dump arms rather surrender continue fight incapable winning. Éamon Valera supported order, issuing statement Anti-Treaty fighters May: Soldiers Republic. Legion Rearguard: Republic longer defended successfully arms. Further sacrifice life vain continuance struggle arms unwise national interest prejudicial future cause. Military victory allowed rest moment destroyed Republic. Free State government started peace negotiations early May, broke down. High Court Justice Ireland ruled 1923 state war longer existed, consequently internment republicans, permitted common law wartime, illegal. Without formal peace, holding 13,000 prisoners worried fighting break again time, government enacted two Public Safety Emergency Powers Acts 1923, permit continued internment measures. Thousands Anti-Treaty IRA members including Éamon Valera arrested Free State forces weeks months end war, when dumped arms returned home. 1923, general election held, Cumann nGaedheal, pro-Free State party, won 40% first-preference vote. Republicans, represented Sinn Féin, won 27% vote. candidates supporters imprisoned before, during election. 1923, around 8,000 12,000 Republican prisoners Free State gaols went hunger strike. strike lasted days met little success among died Denny Barry Andy O'Sullivan. However, women prisoners released shortly thereafter hunger strike helped concentrate Republican movement prisoners associated organisations.

Among prominent senators whose homes attacked were: Palmerstown House near Naas, belonged Earl Mayo, Moore Hall Mayo, Horace Plunkett helped establish rural co-operative schemes, Senator Henry Guinness unsuccessful. burned Marlfield House Clonmel, home Senator John Philip Bagwell its extensive library historical documents. Bagwell kidnapped held Dublin Mountains, later released when reprisals threatened. However, addition allegiance Free State, factors behind Republican animosity towards old landed class. Many, not people, supported Crown forces during War Independence. support often largely moral, sometimes took form actively assisting British conflict. attacks ended Truce 1921, continued truce escalated during Civil War. 1922, Con Moloney, anti-treaty IRA's Deputy Chief Staff, ordered unionist property seized accommodate men.

Whereas Fianna Fáil become dominant party Irish politics, Sinn Féin became small, isolated political party. IRA, numerous influential Sinn Féin, remained associated Fianna Fáil though not directly until banned Valera 1935. 1927, Fianna Fáil members took Oath Allegiance entered Dáil, effectively recognising legitimacy Free State. Free State already moving towards independence point. Statute Westminster 1931, British Parliament gave its right legislate members British Commonwealth.

Finally, 1948, coalition government, containing elements sides Civil War pro-treaty Fine Gael anti-treaty Clann Poblachta left British Commonwealth renamed Free State Republic Ireland. 1950s, issues Civil War fought largely settled. civil wars, internecine conflict left bitter legacy, continues influence Irish politics day. two largest political parties republic its history until 2011 Irish General Election Fianna Fáil Fine Gael, descendants respectively anti-treaty pro-treaty forces 1922. Until 1970s, almost Ireland's prominent politicians veterans Civil War, fact poisoned relationship Ireland's two biggest parties. Examples Civil War veterans include: Republicans Éamon Valera, Frank Aiken, Todd Andrews, Seán Lemass; Free State supporters Cosgrave, Richard Mulcahy Kevin O'Higgins. Moreover, men's sons daughters became politicians, meaning personal wounds civil war felt three generations. 1930s, Fianna Fáil took power first time, looked possible Civil War break again IRA pro-Free State Blueshirts.
