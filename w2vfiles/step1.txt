Unlike social groups (wealth, age, hobbies), ethnicity often inherited status based society person lives. cases, adopted person moves society. Membership ethnic group tends defined shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language dialect, symbolic systems religion, mythology ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, physical appearance. Ethnic groups, derived historical founder population, often continue speak related languages share similar gene pool; grouped ethno-linguistic groups (e.g. Germanic peoples, Iranian peoples, Slavic peoples, Bantu peoples, Turkic peoples, Austronesian peoples, Nilotic peoples, etc.) language shift, acculturation, adoption religious conversion, individuals groups leave ethnic group become part (except ethnic groups emphasizing racial purity membership criterion). Ethnicity often used synonymously ambiguous terms nation people. English, connotation something exotic (cf. "White ethnic", "ethnic restaurant", etc.), generally related cultures recent immigrants, arrived founding population area established. Depending source group identity emphasized define membership, following types (often mutually overlapping) groups identified: Ethno-linguistic, emphasizing shared language, dialect script example: Gaels Ethno-national, emphasizing shared polity sense national identity example: Iraqis Ethno-racial, emphasizing shared physical appearance based genetic origins example: African Americans Ethno-regional, emphasizing distinct local sense belonging stemming relative geographic isolation example: South Islanders Ethno-religious, emphasizing shared affiliation particular religion, denomination sect example: Sikhs cases instance, sense Jewish peoplehood aspect determines membership. largest ethnic groups modern times comprise hundreds millions individuals (Han Chinese largest), smallest limited dozen individuals (numerous indigenous peoples worldwide). Larger ethnic groups subdivided smaller sub-groups known variously tribes clans, time become separate ethnic groups themselves endogamy physical isolation parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities merge form pan-ethnicity, eventually merge single ethnicity. Whether division amalgamation, formation separate ethnic identity referred ethnogenesis. term ethnic derived Greek word ἔθνος ethnos (more precisely, adjective ἐθνικός ethnikos, loaned Latin ethnicus). inherited English language term concept folk, used alongside latinate people late Middle English period. Early Modern English until mid-19th century, ethnic used mean heathen pagan sense disparate "nations" participate Christian oikumene), Septuagint used ethne ("the nations") translate Hebrew goyim "the nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews". Greek term early antiquity (Homeric Greek) refer large group, host men, band comrades swarm flock animals. Classical Greek, term took meaning comparable concept expressed "ethnic group", mostly translated "nation, people"; Hellenistic Greek term tend become further narrowed refer "foreign" "barbarous" nations particular (whence later meaning "heathen, pagan"). 19th century, term used sense "peculiar race, people nation", return Greek meaning. sense "different cultural groups", English "racial, cultural national minority group" arises 1930s 1940s, serving replacement term race earlier taken sense becoming deprecated association ideological racism. abstract ethnicity used "paganism" 18th century, express meaning "ethnic character" (first recorded 1953). term ethnic group first recorded 1935 entered Oxford English Dictionary 1972. Depending context used, term nationality either used synonymously ethnicity, synonymously citizenship sovereign state). process results emergence ethnicity called ethnogenesis, term ethnological literature 1950. Ethnography begins classical antiquity; early authors Anaximander Hecataeus Miletus, Herodotus laid foundation historiography ethnography ancient world. Greeks time describe foreign nations developed concept "ethnicity", grouped name Hellenes. Herodotus (8.144.2) gave famous account defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity day, enumerating shared descent (ὅμαιμον homaimon, blood"), shared language (ὁμόγλωσσον homoglōsson, "speaking language") shared sanctuaries sacrifices (Greek: θεῶν ἱδρύματά κοινὰ θυσίαι theōn hidrumata koina thusiai) shared customs (Greek: ἤθεα ὁμότροπα ēthea homotropa, "customs fashion"). Whether ethnicity qualifies cultural universal extent dependent exact definition used. According "Challenges Measuring Ethnic World: Science, politics, reality", Challenges Measuring Ethnic World: Science, Politics Reality Proceedings Joint Canada-United States Conference Measurement Ethnicity, 1–3, 1992, Joint Canada-United States Conference Measurement Ethnicity, Department Commerce, Statistics Canada, 1993, conference organised Statistics Canada United States Census Bureau (April 1–3, 1992). social scientists, anthropologists Fredrik Barth Eric Wolf, consider ethnic identity universal. regard ethnicity product specific kinds inter-group interactions, rather essential quality inherent human groups. According Thomas Hylland Eriksen, study ethnicity dominated distinct debates until recently. primordialist view, participant perceives ethnic ties collectively, externally given, even coercive, social bond. instrumentalist approach, hand, treats ethnicity primarily ad-hoc element political strategy, used resource interest groups achieving secondary goals instance, increase wealth, power, status. debate important point reference Political science, although scholars' approaches fall poles. second debate "constructivism" "essentialism". Constructivists view national ethnic identities product historical forces, often recent, even when identities presented old. Essentialists view identities ontological categories defining social actors, result social action. According Eriksen, debates superseded, especially anthropology, scholars' attempts respond increasingly politicised forms self-representation members different ethnic groups nations. context debates multiculturalism countries, United States Canada, large immigrant populations different cultures, post-colonialism Caribbean South Asia. Weber maintained ethnic groups künstlich (artificial, i.e. social construct) based subjective belief shared Gemeinschaft (community). Secondly, belief shared Gemeinschaft create group; group created belief. Third, group formation resulted drive monopolise power status. contrary prevailing naturalist belief time, held socio-cultural behavioral differences peoples stemmed inherited traits tendencies derived common descent, called "race". influential theoretician ethnicity Fredrik Barth, whose "Ethnic Groups Boundaries" 1969 described instrumental spreading usage term social studies 1980s 1990s. Barth went further Weber stressing constructed nature ethnicity. Barth, ethnicity perpetually negotiated renegotiated external ascription internal self-identification. Barth's view ethnic groups discontinuous cultural isolates, logical prioris people naturally belong. wanted part anthropological notions cultures bounded entities, ethnicity primordialist bonds, replacing focus interface groups. "Ethnic Groups Boundaries", therefore, focus interconnectedness ethnic identities. Barth writes: "... categorical ethnic distinctions depend absence mobility, contact information, entail social processes exclusion incorporation whereby discrete categories maintained despite changing participation membership course individual life histories." 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed identification "ethnic groups" usage social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels indigenous realities: named ethnic identities accept, often unthinkingly, basic givens literature often arbitrarily, even worse inaccurately, imposed. way, pointed fact identification ethnic group outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, coincide self-identification members group. described first decades usage, term ethnicity often used lieu older terms "cultural" "tribal" when referring smaller groups shared cultural systems shared heritage, "ethnicity" added value able describe commonalities systems group identity tribal modern societies. Cohen suggested claims concerning "ethnic" identity (like earlier claims concerning "tribal" identity) often colonialist practices effects relations colonized peoples nation-states. According Paul James, formations identity often changed distorted colonization, identities made nothing: [C]ategorizations identity, even when codified hardened clear typologies processes colonization, state formation general modernizing processes, always full tensions contradictions. Sometimes contradictions destructive, creative positive. Social scientists thus focused how, when, different markers ethnic identity become salient. Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed ethnic boundaries often mercurial character. Ronald Cohen concluded ethnicity series nesting dichotomizations inclusiveness exclusiveness". agrees Joan Vincent's observation Cohen's paraphrase) "Ethnicity narrowed broadened boundary terms relation specific needs political mobilization. descent sometimes marker ethnicity, sometimes not: diacritic ethnicity salient depends whether people scaling ethnic boundaries down, whether scaling down depends generally political situation. Different approaches understanding ethnicity used different social scientists when trying understand nature ethnicity factor human life society. Examples approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism instrumentalism. "Primordialism", holds ethnicity existed times human history modern ethnic groups historical continuity past. them, idea ethnicity closely linked idea nations rooted pre-Weber understanding humanity divided primordially existing groups rooted kinship biological heritage. "Essentialist primordialism" further holds ethnicity priori fact human existence, ethnicity precedes human social interaction basically unchanged theory sees ethnic groups natural, just historical. problems dealing consequences intermarriage, migration colonization composition modern multi-ethnic societies. "Kinship primordialism" holds ethnic communities extensions kinship units, basically derived kinship clan ties choices cultural signs (language, religion, traditions) made exactly show biological affinity. way, myths common biological ancestry defining feature ethnic communities understood representing actual biological history. problem view ethnicity often case mythic origins specific ethnic groups directly contradict known biological history ethnic community. "Geertz's primordialism", notably espoused anthropologist Clifford Geertz, argues humans general attribute overwhelming power primordial human "givens" blood ties, language, territory, cultural differences. Geertz' opinion, ethnicity itself primordial humans perceive embedded experience world. "Perennialism", approach primarily concerned nationhood tends nations ethnic communities basically phenomenon, holds nation, type social political organisation, immemorial "perennial" character. Smith (1999) distinguishes variants: "continuous perennialism", claims particular nations existed long spans time, "recurrent perennialism", focuses emergence, dissolution reappearance nations recurring aspect human history."Perpetual perennialism" holds specific ethnic groups existed continuously throughout history. "Situational perennialism" holds nations ethnic groups emerge, change vanish course history. view holds concept ethnicity basically tool used political groups manipulate resources wealth, power, territory status particular groups' interests. Accordingly, ethnicity emerges when relevant means furthering emergent collective interests changes according political changes society. Examples perennialist interpretation ethnicity found Barth, Seidner ethnicity ever-changing boundaries groups people established ongoing social negotiation interaction. "Instrumentalist perennialism", seeing ethnicity primarily versatile tool identified different ethnics groups limits time, explains ethnicity mechanism social stratification, meaning ethnicity basis hierarchical arrangement individuals. According Donald Noel, sociologist developed theory origin ethnic stratification, ethnic stratification "system stratification wherein relatively fixed group membership (e.g., race, religion, nationality) utilized major criterion assigning social positions". Ethnic stratification different types social stratification, including stratification based socio-economic status, race, gender. According Donald Noel, ethnic stratification will emerge when specific ethnic groups brought contact another, when groups characterized high degree ethnocentrism, competition, differential power. Ethnocentrism tendency look world primarily perspective one's culture, downgrade groups outside one's culture. sociologists, Lawrence Bobo Vincent Hutchings, origin ethnic stratification lies individual dispositions ethnic prejudice, relates theory ethnocentrism. Continuing Noel's theory, degree differential power present emergence ethnic stratification. words, inequality power among ethnic groups means "they unequal power able impose will upon another". addition differential power, degree competition structured along ethnic lines prerequisite ethnic stratification well. different ethnic groups competing common goal, power influence, material interest, wealth territory. Lawrence Bobo Vincent Hutchings propose competition driven self-interest hostility, results inevitable stratification conflict. "Constructivism" sees primordialist perennialist views basically flawed, rejects notion ethnicity basic human condition. holds ethnic groups products human social interaction, maintained maintained valid social constructs societies. "Modernist constructivism" correlates emergence ethnicity movement towards nation states beginning early modern period. Proponents theory, Eric Hobsbawm, argue ethnicity notions ethnic pride, nationalism, purely modern inventions, appearing modern period world history. hold prior this, ethnic homogeneity considered ideal necessary factor forging large-scale societies. Ethnicity important means people identify larger group. social scientists, anthropologists Fredrik Barth Eric Wolf, consider ethnic identity universal. regard ethnicity product specific kinds inter-group interactions, rather essential quality inherent human groups. Processes result emergence identification called ethnogenesis. Members ethnic group, whole, claim cultural continuities time, although historians cultural anthropologists documented values, practices, norms imply continuity past relatively recent invention. Ethnic groups differ social groups, subcultures, interest groups social classes, emerge change historical periods (centuries) process known ethnogenesis, period several generations endogamy resulting common ancestry (which sometimes cast terms mythological narrative founding figure); ethnic identity reinforced reference "boundary markers" characteristics unique group apart groups. Ethnicity theory says race social category several factors determining ethnicity. criteria include: "religion, language, 'customs,' nationality, political identification". theory forth sociologist Robert based notion “culture”. theory preceded century biological essentialism dominant paradigm race. Biological essentialism belief white European races biologically superior non-white races inherently inferior. view arose justify slavery Africans genocide Native Americans society supposedly founded freedom all. notion developed slowly preoccupation scientists, theologians, public. Religious institutions asked questions whether multiple genesis's (polygenesis) whether created lesser races men. foremost scientists time took idea racial difference. inadvertently find white Europeans superior. method used measurement cranial capacity. Ethnicity theory based assimilation model. Park outlined four steps assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, assimilation. Instead explaining marginalized status people color United States inherent biological inferiority, instead failure assimilate American culture held people back. equal long dropped culture deficient compared white culture. Michael Howard Winant's theory racial formation directly confronts ethnicity theory's premises practices. argue Racial Formation United States ethnicity theory exclusively based immigration patterns white ethnic population account unique experiences non-whites country. theory identities different stages immigration process contact, conflict, struggle, last best response, assimilation white ethnic communities. ethnicity paradigm neglects ways race complicate community's interactions basic social political structures, especially upon contact. assimilation shedding particular qualities native culture purpose blending host culture work groups response racism discrimination others. Moreover, once legal barriers achieving equality dismantled, problem racism became sole responsibility already disadvantaged communities. assumed Black Latino community 'making standards white ethnics, community hold right values beliefs. stubbornly resisting dominant norms want Winant's critique ethnicity theory explains looking towards cultural defect source inequality ignores "concrete sociopolitical dynamics within racial phenomena operate U.S." words, buying approach effectively strips ability critically examine structural components racism encourages, instead, “benign neglect” social inequality. cases, especially involving transnational migration, colonial expansion, ethnicity linked nationality. Anthropologists historians, following modernist understanding ethnicity proposed Ernest Gellner Benedict Anderson nations nationalism developing rise modern state system 17th century. culminated rise "nation-states" presumptive boundaries nation coincided ideally coincided) state boundaries. Thus, West, notion ethnicity, race nation, developed context European colonial expansion, when mercantilism capitalism promoting global movements populations time state boundaries clearly rigidly defined. 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy claim represent "nations." Nation-states, however, invariably include populations excluded national life reason another. Members excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion basis equality, seek autonomy, sometimes even extent complete political separation nation-state. conditions—when people moved state another, state conquered colonized peoples beyond national boundaries—ethnic groups formed people identified nation, lived state. Multi-ethnic states result opposite events, either recent creation state borders variance traditional tribal territories, recent immigration ethnic minorities former nation state. Examples first case found throughout Africa, countries created during decolonisation inherited arbitrary colonial borders, European countries Belgium United Kingdom. Examples second case countries Germany Netherlands, ethnically homogeneous when attained statehood received significant immigration during second half 20th century. States United Kingdom, France Switzerland comprised distinct ethnic groups formation likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting termed "multicultural" societies especially large cities. states World multi-ethnic onset, formed colonies imposed existing indigenous populations. recent decades feminist scholars (most notably Nira Yuval-Davis) drawn attention fundamental ways women participate creation reproduction ethnic national categories. Though categories usually discussed belonging public, political sphere, upheld within private, family sphere great extent. women just biological reproducers 'cultural carriers', transmitting knowledge enforcing behaviours belong specific collectivity. Women often play significant symbolic role conceptions nation ethnicity, example notion 'women children' constitute kernel nation defended times conflict, iconic figures Britannia Marianne. Race ethnicity considered related concepts. Ethnicity often assumed somewhat cultural identity group, often based shared ancestry, language cultural tradition, race assumed strictly biological classification, based bone structure. Race controversial subject ethnicity, common political use. assumed that, based power relations, exist 'racialized ethnicities' 'ethnicized races'. Ramón Grosfoguel (University California, Berkeley) argues 'racial/ethnic identity' concept concepts race ethnicity cannot used separate autonomous categories. Weber, race ethnicity primarily seen aspects thing. Around 1900 before, essentialist primordialist understanding ethnicity predominant: cultural differences peoples seen result inherited traits tendencies. Weber's introduction view ethnicity social construct, race ethnicity became divided other. 1950, UNESCO statement, "The Race Question", signed internationally renowned scholars time (including Ashley Montagu, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal, Julian Huxley, etc.), suggested that: "National, religious, geographic, linguistic cultural groups necessarily coincide racial groups: cultural traits groups demonstrated genetic connection racial traits. serious errors kind habitually committed when term 'race' used popular parlance, better when speaking human races drop term 'race' altogether speak 'ethnic groups'." 1982 anthropologist David Craig Griffith summed forty years ethnographic research, arguing racial ethnic categories symbolic markers different ways people different parts world incorporated global economy: opposing interests divide working classes further reinforced appeals "racial" "ethnic" distinctions. appeals serve allocate different categories workers rungs scale labor markets, relegating stigmatized populations lower levels insulating higher echelons competition below. Capitalism create distinctions ethnicity race function categories workers another. nevertheless, process labor mobilization capitalism imparts distinctions effective values. According Wolf, racial categories constructed incorporated during period European mercantile expansion, ethnic groupings during period capitalist expansion. Writing usage term "ethnic" ordinary language Great Britain United States, 1977 Wallman noted term 'ethnic' popularly connotes '[race]' Britain, less precisely, lighter value load. North America, contrast, '[race]' commonly means color, 'ethnics' descendants relatively recent immigrants non-English-speaking countries. '[Ethnic]' noun Britain. effect 'ethnics'; 'ethnic relations'. U.S., defines concept race outlined Census "scientific anthropological" takes account "social cultural characteristics ancestry", using "appropriate scientific methodologies" "primarily biological genetic reference." Sometimes ethnic groups subject prejudicial attitudes actions state constituents. 20th century, people began argue conflicts among ethnic groups members ethnic group state resolved ways. Some, Jürgen Habermas Bruce Barry, argued legitimacy modern states based notion political rights autonomous individual subjects. According view, state acknowledge ethnic, national racial identity rather instead enforce political legal equality individuals. Others, Charles Taylor Will Kymlicka, argue notion autonomous individual itself cultural construct. According view, states recognize ethnic identity develop processes particular needs ethnic groups accommodated within boundaries nation-state. 19th century development political ideology ethnic nationalism, when concept race tied nationalism, first German theorists including Johann Gottfried Herder. Instances societies focusing ethnic ties, arguably exclusion history historical context, resulted justification nationalist goals. periods frequently cited examples 19th century consolidation expansion German Empire 20th century Nazi Germany. promoted pan-ethnic idea governments acquiring lands always inhabited ethnic Germans. history late-comers nation-state model, arising Near East south-eastern Europe dissolution Ottoman Austro-Hungarian Empires, arising former USSR, marked inter-ethnic conflicts. conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, opposed them, regions world. Thus, conflicts often misleadingly labelled characterized civil wars when inter-ethnic conflicts multi-ethnic state.

Apart global continental regions, hydrospheric atmospheric regions cover oceans, discrete climates above land water masses planet. land water global regions divided subregions geographically bounded large geological features influence large-scale ecologies, plains features. describing spatial areas, concept regions important widely used among branches geography, describe areas regional terms. example, ecoregion term used environmental geography, cultural region cultural geography, bioregion biogeography, field geography studies regions themselves called regional geography. fields physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, environmental geography, regions tend based natural features ecosystems biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. human geography concerned, regions subregions described discipline ethnography. region nature moved. first nature natural environment (landform, climate, etc.). second nature physical elements complex built people past. third nature socio-cultural context replaced immigrants. Global regions distinguishable space, therefore clearly distinguished basic terrestrial environments, land water. However, generally recognised earlier terrestrial cartography impact human geography. divided largest land regions, known continents, largest water regions known oceans. significant regions belong either classification, archipelago regions littoral regions, earthquake regions defined geology. Continental regions usually based broad experiences human history attempts reduce large areas manageable regionalization purpose study. conceptual constructs, usually lacking distinct boundaries. Oceanic division maritime regions used conjunction relationship central area continent, using directions compass. continental regions defined major continental feature identity, Amazon basin, Sahara, occupy significant percentage respective continental land area. large extent, major continental regions mental constructs created considering efficient define large areas continents. part, images world derived academic studies, media, personal experience global exploration. matter collective human knowledge planet attempts better understand environments. Regional geography branch geography studies regions sizes across Earth. prevailing descriptive character. main understand define uniqueness character particular region, consists natural human elements. Attention paid regionalization, covers proper techniques space delimitation regions. Regional geography considered certain approach study geographical sciences (similar quantitative critical geographies; information, history geography). Human geography branch geography focuses study patterns processes shape human interaction various discrete environments. encompasses human, political, cultural, social, economic aspects among others often clearly delineated. major focus human geography physical landscape Earth (see physical geography), hardly possible discuss human geography without referring physical landscape human activities played out, environmental geography emerging link two. Regions human geography divided broad categories: Cultural geography Demography Development geography Economic geography Ethnography Geopolitics Health geography Historical geography Language geography Religion geography Social geography Time geography Tourism geography Transportation geography Urban geography field historical geography involves study human history relates places regions study places regions changed time. Meinig, historical geographer America, describes historical regions book Shaping America: Geographical Perspective Years History. example, identifying European "source regions" early American colonization efforts, defines describes Northwest European Atlantic Protestant Region, includes sub-regions "Western Channel Community", itself made sub-regions English West Country Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset. describing historic regions America, Meinig writes "The Great Fishery" coast Newfoundland England, oceanic region includes Grand Banks. rejects regions traditionally used describing American history, France, "West Indies", Middle Colonies, individual colonies themselves (Province Maryland, example). Instead writes "discrete colonization areas," named colonies rarely adhere strictly political boundaries. Historic regions type Meinig writes include "Greater England" major sub-regions "Plymouth," "New Haven shores" (including parts Long Island), "Rhode Island" "Narragansett Bay"), "the Piscataqua," "Massachusetts Bay," "Connecticut Valley," lesser degree, regions sphere influence Greater England, "Acadia" (Nova Scotia), "Newfoundland Fishery/The Banks." examples historical regions include Iroquoia, Ohio Country, Illinois Country, Rupert's Land. tourism region geographical region designated governmental organization tourism bureau having common cultural environmental characteristics. regions often named geographical, former, current administrative region name created tourism purposes. names often evoke certain positive qualities area suggest coherent tourism experience visitors. Countries, states, provinces, administrative regions often carved tourism regions facilitate attracting visitors. famous tourism regions based historical current administrative regions include Tuscany Italy Yucatán Mexico. Famous examples regions created government tourism bureau include United Kingdom's Lake District California's Wine Country. great plains region Natural resources often occur distinct regions. Natural resource regions topic physical geography environmental geography, strong element human geography economic geography. coal region, example, physical geomorphological region, development exploitation economic cultural region. examples natural resource regions include Rumaila Field, field lies along border Iraq Kuwait played role Gulf War; Coal Region Pennsylvania, historical region cultural, physical, natural resource region; South Wales Coalfield, Pennsylvania's coal region historical, cultural, natural region; Kuznetsk Basin, similarly important coal mining region Russia; Kryvbas, economic iron mining region Ukraine; James Project, large region Quebec largest hydroelectric systems world developed. Sometimes region associated religion given name, Christendom, term medieval renaissance connotations Christianity sort social political polity. term Muslim world sometimes used refer region world Islam dominant. broad terms vague when used describe regions. Within religions clearly defined regions. Roman Catholic Church, Church England, Eastern Orthodox Church, others, define ecclesiastical regions names diocese, eparchy, ecclesiastical provinces, parish. example, United States divided Roman Catholic ecclesiastical provinces. Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod organized geographic districts, subdivided circuits (the Atlantic District (LCMS), example). Church Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints uses regions similar dioceses parishes, uses terms ward stake. field political geography, regions tend based political units sovereign states; subnational units administrative regions, provinces, states United States), counties, townships, territories, etc.; multinational groupings, including formally defined units European Union, Association Southeast Asian Nations, NATO, informally defined regions Third World, Western Europe, Middle East. word "region" taken Latin regio (derived regere, rule), number countries borrowed term formal name type subnational entity (e.g., región, used Chile). English, word used conventional translation equivalent terms languages (e.g., область (oblast), used Russia alongside broader term регион). following countries term "region" cognate) name type subnational administrative unit: Belgium French, région; German, Region; Dutch term gewest often translated "region") Chad (région, effective 2002) Chile (región) Côte d'Ivoire (région) Denmark (effective 2007) England (not United Kingdom whole) Eritrea France (région) Ghana Guinea (région) Guinea-Bissau (região) Guyana Hungary (régió) Italy (regione) Madagascar (région) Mali (région) Malta (reġjun) Namibia Zealand Peru (región) Portugal (região) Philippines (rehiyon) Senegal (région) Tanzania Togo (région) Trinidad Tobago (Regional Corporation) Canadian province Québec uses "administrative region" (région administrative). Scotland local government regions 1975 1996. Spain official name autonomous community Murcia Región Murcia. Also, single-province autonomous communities Madrid term región interchangeably comunidad autónoma. (counties) Sweden called 'regions': Skåne Västra Götaland, currently controversial proposal divide rest Sweden large regions, replacing current counties. government Philippines uses term "region" Filipino, rehiyon) when it's necessary group provinces, primary administrative subdivision country. case Brazil, groups primary administrative divisions (estados; "states") grandes regiões (greater regions) statistical purposes, Russia uses экономические районы (economic regions) similar way, does Romania Venezuela. government Singapore makes term "region" administrative purposes. following countries administrative subdivision conventionally referred region English: Bulgaria, uses област (oblast) Russia, uses область (oblast'), regions край (krai) Ukraine, uses область (oblast') Slovakia (kraj) China five (zìzhìqū) 特別行政區 特别行政区; tèbiéxíngzhèngqū), translated "autonomous region" "special administrative region", respectively. relatively small regions based local government agencies districts, agencies, regions. general, regions general sense bounded spatial units. Examples include electoral districts Washington's congressional district Tennessee's congressional district; school districts Granite School District Angeles Unified School District; economic districts Reedy Creek Improvement District; metropolitan areas Seattle metropolitan area, metropolitan districts Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Greater Chicago, Vegas-Clark County Library District, Metropolitan Police Service Greater London, local districts York Rural Sanitary District, Delaware River Port Authority, Nassau County Soil Water Conservation District, C-TRAN. traditional territorial divisions countries commonly rendered English "regions". informal divisions form basis modern administrative divisions countries, define delimit local regional identity sense belonging. Examples include: Finland Japan Korea Norway (landsdeler) Romania Slovakia Functional regions usually understood areas organised horizontal functional relations (flows, interactions) maximised within region minimised across borders principles internal cohesiveness external separation regarding spatial interactions (see, instance, Farmer Fotheringham, 2011; Klapka al., 2013; Smart, 1974). functional region abstract spatial concept, certain extent regarded reflection spatial behaviour individuals geographic space. functional region conceived general concept inner structure, inner spatial flows, interactions need necessarily show regular pattern, selfcontainment. concept self-containment remains crucial defining characteristic functional region. Nodal regions, functional urban regions, daily urban systems, local labour-market areas (LLMAs), travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) considered special instances general functional region need fulfil specific conditions regarding, instance, character region-organising interaction presence urban cores, (Halas al., 2015). military usage, region shorthand name military formation larger Army Group smaller Army Theater simply Theater. full name military formation Army Region. size Army Region vary widely generally somewhere million million soldiers.
