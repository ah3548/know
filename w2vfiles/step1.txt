Etymologic legend Romanic peoples adopted foreign, Germanic word "war", avoid using Latin bellum, because, when sounded, tended merge sound word bello "beautiful". scholarly study war sometimes called polemology American English: /ˌpɑːləˈmɑːlədʒi/ pah-lə-MAHL-ə-jee, Greek polemos, meaning "war", -logy, meaning "the study of". War entail degree confrontation using weapons military technology equipment armed forces employing military tactics operational art within broad military strategy subject military logistics. Studies war military theorists throughout military history sought identify philosophy war, reduce military science. Modern military science considers several factors national defence policy created allow war commence: environment areas combat operations, posture national forces will adopt commencement war, type warfare troops will engaged in. Asymmetric warfare conflict two populations drastically different levels military capability size. Biological warfare, germ warfare, use weaponized biological toxins infectious agents bacteria, viruses, fungi. Chemical warfare involves use weaponized chemicals combat. Poison gas chemical weapon principally used during World War resulted million estimated casualties, including 100,000 civilians. Civil war war forces belonging nation political entity. Conventional warfare declared war states nuclear, biological, chemical weapons not used limited deployment. Cyberwarfare involves actions nation-state international organization attack attempt damage nation's information systems. Nuclear warfare warfare nuclear weapons primary, major, method achieving capitulation. Total war warfare means possible, disregarding laws war, placing limits legitimate military targets, using weapons tactics resulting significant civilian casualties, demanding war effort requiring significant sacrifices friendly civilian population. Unconventional warfare, opposite conventional warfare, attempt achieve military victory acquiescence, capitulation, clandestine support one side existing conflict. War aggression war conquest gain rather self-defense; basis war crimes customary international law. earliest recorded evidence war belongs Mesolithic cemetery Site 117, determined approximately 14,000 years old. forty-five percent skeletons displayed signs violent death. rise state 5,000 years ago, military activity occurred globe. advent gunpowder acceleration technological advances led modern warfare. Henderson, "One source claims 14,500 wars taken place 3500 late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving 300 years peace Beer 1981: 20.". unfavorable review estimate mentions following regarding one proponents estimate: «In addition, perhaps feeling war casualties figure improbably high, changed "approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings killed war diseases produced war" "approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings...&c.".» lower figure plausible. pre-civilization times, warfare estimated accounted 15.1 deaths claimed 400 million victims. Added previous figure 1,240 million mean total 1,640,000,000 people killed war including deaths famine disease caused war throughout history pre-history mankind. comparison, estimated 1,680,000,000 people died infectious diseases 20th Century. Nuclear warfare breaking 1988, when nuclear arsenals peak level, aftermath thereof, reduced human population 5,150,000,000 1,850,000,000 3,300,000,000 within period one year, according projection doesn't consider "the severe predictions concerning nuclear winter". proportional reduction world’s population exceeding reduction caused 14th Century Black Death, comparable proportional terms plague’s impact Europe's population 1346-53. War Civilization, Lawrence Keeley, professor University Illinois, says approximately 90–95% known societies throughout history engaged least occasional warfare, fought constantly. Keeley describes several styles primitive combat small raids, large raids, massacres. forms warfare used primitive societies, finding supported researchers. Keeley explains early war raids not organized, participants not formal training. Scarcity resources meant defensive works not cost effective protect society against enemy raids. William Rubinstein wrote "Pre-literate societies, even organised relatively advanced way, renowned studied cruelty...'archaeology yields evidence prehistoric massacres severe recounted ethnography [i.e., coming Europeans].'" Western Europe, late 18th century, 150 conflicts 600 battles taken place. During 20th century, war resulted dramatic intensification pace social changes, crucial catalyst emergence Left force reckoned with. Recent rapid increases technologies war, therefore its destructiveness mutual assured destruction, caused widespread public concern, probability forestalled, altogether prevent outbreak nuclear World War III. end last two World Wars, concerted popular efforts made greater understanding underlying dynamics war thereby hopefully reduce even eliminate altogether. efforts materialized forms League Nations, its successor, United Nations. Shortly World War II, token support concept, nations joined United Nations. During post-war period, aim further delegitimizing war acceptable logical extension foreign policy, national governments renamed Ministries Departments War Ministries Departments Defense, example, former U.S. Department War renamed U.S. 1947, view rapidly increasingly destructive consequences modern warfare, particular concern consequences costs newly developed atom bomb, Albert Einstein famously stated, know not weapons World War III will fought, World War will fought sticks stones." Mao Zedong urged socialist camp not fear nuclear war United States since, even "half mankind died, half remain imperialism razed ground whole world become socialist." Human Security Report 2005 documented significant decline number severity armed conflicts end Cold War early 1990s. However, evidence examined 2008 edition Center International Development Conflict Management's "Peace Conflict" study indicated overall decline conflicts stalled. Three ten costly wars, terms loss life, waged last century. two World Wars, followed Second Sino-Japanese War sometimes considered part World War II, overlapping. others involved China neighboring peoples. death toll World War II, million, surpasses war-death-tolls. Military personnel subject combat war often suffer mental physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, disease, injury, death. every war American soldiers fought in, chances becoming psychiatric casualty debilitated period time consequence stresses military life greater chances killed enemy fire. During World War II, research conducted Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall found, average, 15% 20% American riflemen WWII combat fired enemy. Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes 27,574 discarded muskets found Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% loaded, 12,000 loaded once 6,000 loaded times. studies suggest military personnel resist firing weapons combat, theorists argue human beings inherent resistance killing fellow human beings. Swank Marchand’s WWII study found sixty days continuous combat, 98% surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional compulsive states, character disorders. One-tenth mobilised American men hospitalised mental disturbances 1942 1945, thirty-five days uninterrupted combat, 98% manifested psychiatric disturbances varying degrees. Additionally, estimated anywhere 18% 54% Vietnam war veterans suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Based 1860 census figures, white American males aged died American Civil War, including North approximately 18% South. war remains deadliest conflict American history, resulting deaths 620,000 military personnel. United States military casualties war 1775 totaled two million. million European military personnel mobilized World War million killed, million permanently disabled, million seriously injured. During Napoleon's retreat Moscow, French military personnel died typhus killed Russians. 450,000 soldiers crossed Neman 1812, less 40,000 returned. military personnel killed 1500–1914 typhus military action. addition, not modern medical advances thousands dead disease infection. instance, during Seven Years' War, Royal Navy reported conscripted 184,899 sailors, whom 133,708 died disease 'missing'. estimated 1985 1994, 378,000 people per year died due war. wars resulted significant loss life, along destruction infrastructure resources lead famine, disease, death civilian population. During Thirty Years' War Europe, population Holy Roman Empire reduced percent. Civilians war zones subject war atrocities genocide, survivors suffer psychological aftereffects witnessing destruction war. estimates World War casualties indicate around million people died, million civilians. Deaths Soviet Union around million. high proportion killed young men not yet fathered children, population growth postwar Soviet Union lower otherwise been. Once war ended, losing nations sometimes required pay war reparations victorious nations. certain cases, land ceded victorious nations. example, territory Alsace-Lorraine traded France Germany three different occasions. Typically, war becomes intertwined economy wars partially entirely based economic reasons. economists believe war stimulate country's economy high government spending World War often credited bringing USA Great Depression Keynesian economists cases, wars Louis XIV, Franco-Prussian War, World War warfare primarily results damage economy countries involved. example, Russia's involvement World War took toll Russian economy almost collapsed greatly contributed start Russian Revolution 1917. World War financially costly conflict history: its belligerents cumulatively spent trillion U.S. dollars war effort adjusted 1940 prices. Great Depression 1930s ended nations increased production war materials. end war, 70% European industrial infrastructure destroyed. Property damage Soviet Union inflicted Axis invasion estimated value 679 billion rubles. combined damage consisted complete partial destruction 1,710 cities towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 64,374 railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, 43,000 public libraries. War leads forced migration causing potentially large displacements population. Among forced migrants usually relatively large shares artists types creative people, causing war effects particularly harmful country’s creative potential long-run. War negative effect artists’ individual life-cycle output. war, cultural institutions, libraries, become "targets themselves; elimination denigrate demoralize enemy population." impact destruction society important "in era competing ideologies fuel internal international conflict, destruction libraries items cultural significance neither random nor irrelevant. Preserving world’s repositories knowledge crucial ensuring darkest moments history not endlessly repeat themselves." Entities deliberately contemplating going war entities considering whether end war formulate war aims evaluation/propaganda tool. War aims stand proxy national-military resolve. Fried defines war aims "the desired territorial, economic, military benefits expected following successful conclusion war". Tangible/intangible aims: Tangible war aims involve example acquisition territory German goal Lebensraum first half 20th century recognition economic concessions Anglo-Dutch Wars. Intangible war aims accumulation credibility reputation tangible expression "conquest restores prestige, annexation increases power". Explicit/implicit aims: Explicit war aims involve published policy decisions. Implicit war aims form minutes discussion, memoranda instructions. Positive/negative aims: "Positive war aims" cover tangible outcomes. "Negative war aims" forestall prevent undesired outcomes. War aims change course conflict eventually morph "peace conditions" minimal conditions state cease wage particular war. currently dozens ongoing armed conflicts around world, deadliest Syrian Civil War. Religious groups long formally opposed sought limit war Second Vatican Council document Gaudiem Spes: "Any act war aimed indiscriminately destruction entire cities extensive areas along population crime against God man himself. merits unequivocal unhesitating condemnation." Anti-war movements existed every major war 20th century, including, prominently, World War World War II, Vietnam War. 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred response United States invasion Afghanistan Iraq. Protests opposing War Afghanistan occurred Europe, Asia, United States. Organizations Stop War Coalition, based United Kingdom, worked campaigning against war. Mexican Drug War, estimated casualties 40,000 2006, recently faced fundamental opposition. 2011, movement peace justice started popular middle-class movement against war. won recognition President Calderon, began war. scholarly agreement common motivations war. Carl von Clausewitz said, 'Every age its own kind war, its own limiting conditions, its own peculiar preconceptions.' Dutch psychoanalyst Joost Meerloo held that, "War often...a mass discharge accumulated internal rage where...the inner fears mankind discharged mass destruction." Thus war sometimes means man's own frustration inability master own self expressed temporarily relieved via unleashing destructive behavior upon others. destructive scenario, others made serve scapegoat unspoken subconscious frustrations fears. Durban John Bowlby argued human beings inherently violent. aggressiveness fueled displacement projection person transfers grievances bias hatred against races, religions, nations ideologies. theory, nation state preserves order local society creating outlet aggression warfare. Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, follower Melanie Klein, thought war paranoid projective “elaboration” mourning. Fornari thought war violence develop “love need”: wish preserve defend sacred object attached, namely early mother fusion her. adult, nations sacred objects generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice essence war: astonishing willingness human beings die country, give bodies nation. Despite Fornari's theory man's altruistic desire self-sacrifice noble cause contributing factor towards war,few wars originated desire war among general populace. Far often general population reluctantly drawn war its rulers. One psychological theory looks leaders advanced Maurice Walsh. argues general populace neutral towards war wars occur when leaders psychologically abnormal disregard human life placed power. War caused leaders seek war Napoleon Hitler. leaders often power times crisis when populace opts decisive leader, leads nation war. Naturally, common people don't want war; neither Russia nor England nor America, nor matter Germany. But, all, leaders country determine policy always simple matter drag people along, whether democracy fascist dictatorship Parliament Communist dictatorship. ... people always brought bidding leaders. tell attacked denounce pacifists lack patriotism exposing country danger. Several theories concern evolutionary origins warfare. two main schools: One sees organized warfare emerging Mesolithic result complex social organization greater population density competition resources; sees human warfare ancient practice derived common animal tendencies, territoriality sexual competition. latter school argues warlike behavior patterns found primate species chimpanzees, ant species, group conflict general feature animal social behavior. proponents idea argue war, innate, intensified greatly developments technology social organization weaponry states. Psychologist linguist Steven Pinker argued war-related behaviors naturally selected ancestral environment due benefits victory. argued order credible deterrence against groups individual level, important reputation retaliation, causing humans develop instincts revenge protecting group's individual's reputation "honor". Crofoot Wrangham argued warfare, defined group interactions "coalitions attempt aggressively dominate kill members groups", characteristic human societies. lacking "tend societies politically dominated neighbors". Ashley Montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing social factors childhood socialization important determining nature presence warfare. Thus, argues, warfare not universal human occurrence appears historical invention, associated certain types human societies. Montagu's argument supported ethnographic research conducted societies concept aggression seems entirely absent, e.g. Chewong Semai Malay peninsula. Low observed correlation warfare education, noting societies warfare commonplace encourage children aggressive. War seen growth economic competition competitive international system. view wars begin pursuit markets natural resources wealth. War linked economic development economic historians development economists studying state-building fiscal capacity. theory applied conflicts, counter arguments become less valid increasing mobility capital information level distributions wealth worldwide, when considering relative, not absolute, wealth differences fuel wars. extreme right political spectrum provide support, fascists particular, asserting natural right strong nation whatever weak cannot hold force. centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including Presidents United States U.S. Generals, expressed support economic view war. Marxist theory war quasi-economic states modern wars caused competition resources markets great imperialist powers, claiming wars natural result free market class system. Part theory war will disappear once world revolution, over-throwing free markets class systems, occurred. Marxist philosopher Rosa Luxemburg theorized imperialism result capitalist countries needing new markets. Expansion means production possible corresponding growth consumer demand. workers capitalist economy unable fill demand, producers expand non-capitalist markets find consumers goods, hence driving imperialism. Demographic theories grouped two classes, Malthusian theories youth bulge theories. Malthusian theories expanding population scarce resources source violent conflict. Pope Urban 1095, eve First Crusade, spoke: land inhabit, shut sides sea mountain peaks, narrow large population; scarcely furnishes food enough its cultivators. Hence murder devour one another, wage wars, among perish civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart among you; let quarrels end. Enter upon road Holy Sepulchre; wrest land wicked race, subject yourselves. one earliest expressions called Malthusian theory war, wars caused expanding populations limited resources. Thomas Malthus 1766–1834 wrote populations always increase until limited war, disease, famine. According Heinsohn, proposed youth bulge theory its generalized form, youth bulge occurs when percent males nation belong "fighting age" cohorts years age. will follow periods total fertility rates high 4–8 children per woman 15–29-year delay. Heinsohn saw past "Christianist" European colonialism imperialism, wellas today's Islamist civil unrest terrorism results high birth rates producing youth bulges. Among prominent historical events attributed youth bulges role played historically large youth cohorts rebellion revolution waves early modern Europe, including French Revolution 1789, effect economic depression upon largest German youth cohorts ever explaining rise Nazism Germany 1930s. 1994 Rwandan Genocide analyzed following massive youth bulge. Youth bulge theory subjected statistical analysis World Bank, Population Action International, Berlin Institute Population Development. Youth bulge theories criticized leading racial, gender age discrimination. Rationalism international relations theory framework. Rationalism Neorealism international relations operate assumption states international actors rational, seek best possible outcomes themselves, desire avoid costs war. Game theory approach, rationalist theories posit actors bargain, better off war not occur, likewise seek understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. "Rationalist Explanations War", James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations why countries engage war: Issue Indivisibilities Incentives Misrepresent Information Asymmetry Commitment Problems "Issue indivisibility" occurs when two parties cannot avoid war bargaining, thing fighting cannot shared them, owned entirely one side other. "Information asymmetry incentives misrepresent" occurs when two countries secrets individual capabilities, not agree either: win war them, magnitude state's victory loss. instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues war result miscalculation strength. cites historical examples war demonstrates, "war usually outcome diplomatic crisis cannot solved sides conflicting estimates bargaining power." Thirdly, bargaining fail due states' inability credible commitments. Within rationalist tradition, theorists suggested individuals engaged war suffer normal level cognitive bias, "as rational me". According philosopher Iain King, "Most instigators conflict overrate chances success, participants underrate chances injury...." King asserts "Most catastrophic military decisions rooted GroupThink" faulty, rational. rationalist theory focused around bargaining currently debate. Iraq War proved anomaly undercuts validity applying rationalist theory wars. statistical analysis war pioneered Lewis Fry Richardson following World War recent databases wars armed conflict assembled Correlates War Project, Peter Brecke Uppsala Conflict Data Program. following subsections consider causes war system, societal, individual levels analysis. kind division first proposed Kenneth Waltz Man, State, War often used political scientists then. several different international relations theory schools. Supporters realism international relations argue motivation states quest security, conflicts arise inability distinguish defense offense, called security dilemma. Within realist school represented scholars Henry Kissinger Hans Morgenthau, neorealist school represented scholars Kenneth Waltz John Mearsheimer, two main sub-theories are: Balance power theory: States goal preventing single state becoming hegemon, war result would-be hegemon's persistent attempts power acquisition. view, international system equal distribution power stable, "movements toward unipolarity destabilizing." However, evidence shown power polarity not actually major factor occurrence wars. Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions world order, eventually decline, war occurs when declining hegemon challenged rising power aims preemptively suppress them. view, unlike balance-of-power theory, wars become probable when power equally distributed. "power preponderance" hypothesis empirical support. two theories not mutually exclusive, used explain disparate events according circumstance. Liberalism relates international relations emphasizes factors trade, its role disincentivizing conflict will damage economic relations. Realists respond military force sometimes least effective trade achieving economic benefits, especially historically not today. Furthermore, trade relations result high level dependency, escalate tensions lead conflict. Empirical data relationship trade peace mixed, moreover, evidence suggests countries war don't necessarily trade less other. Diversionary theory, known "scapegoat hypothesis", suggests politically powerful use war diversion rally domestic popular support. supported literature showing outgroup hostility enhances ingroup bonding, significant domestic "rally effect" demonstrated when conflicts begin. However, studies examining increased use force function need internal political support mixed. U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during presidencies several recent U.S. leaders supported diversionary theory. theories suggest differences people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, biases important determining whether conflicts hand. instance, proposed conflict modulated bounded rationality various cognitive biases, prospect theory. morality war subject debate thousands years. two principle aspects ethics war, according Just War Theory jus bellum Jus bello. Jus bellum right war, dictates unfriendly acts circumstances justify proper authority declaring war nation. six main criteria declaration just war: first, just war declared lawful authority; second, just righteous cause, sufficient gravity merit large-scale violence; third, just belligerent rightful intentions namely, seek advance good curtail evil; fourth, just belligerent reasonable chance success; fifth, war last resort; sixth, ends sought proportional means used. Jus bello right war, set ethical rules when conducting war. two main principles proportionality discrimination. Proportionality regards force necessary morally appropriate ends sought injustice suffered. principle discrimination determines legitimate targets war, specifically makes separation combatants, permissible kill, not. Failure follow rules result loss legitimacy just-war-belligerent. Just War Theory foundational creation United Nations International Law's regulations legitimate war. Fascism, ideals encompasses, Pragmatism, racism, social Darwinism, hold violence good. Pragmatism holds war violence good serves ends people, without regard universal morality. Racism holds violence good master race established, purge inferior race earth, both. Social Darwinism asserts violence sometimes necessary weed unfit society civilization flourish. broad archetypes general position ends justify means. Lewis Coser, U.S. conflict theorist sociologist, argued conflict provides function process whereby succession new equilibriums created. Thus, struggle opposing forces, rather disruptive, means balancing maintaining social structure society.

Regardless terminology, forms agreements are, international law, equally considered treaties rules same. Treaties loosely compared contracts: means willing parties assuming obligations among themselves, party either fails live obligations held liable international law. treaty official, express written agreement states use legally bind themselves. treaty official document expresses agreement words; objective outcome ceremonial occasion acknowledges parties defined relationships. late 19th century, treaties followed fairly consistent format. treaty typically begins preamble describing contracting parties joint objectives executing treaty, summarizing underlying events war. Modern preambles sometimes structured single long sentence formatted multiple paragraphs readability, paragraphs begins verb desiring, recognizing, having, on. contracting parties' full names sovereign titles often included preamble, along full names titles representatives, boilerplate clause representatives communicated exchanged full powers i.e., official documents appointing act behalf respective states found good proper form. end preamble start actual agreement often signaled words "have agreed follows." preamble comes numbered articles, contain substance parties' actual agreement. article heading usually encompasses paragraph. long treaty further group articles chapter headings. Modern treaties, regardless subject matter, usually contain articles governing final authentic copies treaty will deposited subsequent disputes interpretation will peacefully resolved. end treaty, eschatocol closing protocol, often signaled clause "in witness whereof" "in faith whereof," parties affixed signatures, followed words "DONE at," sites treaty's execution dates its execution. date typically written its formal, longest possible form. example, Charter United Nations "DONE city San Francisco twenty-sixth day June, one thousand nine hundred forty-five." treaty executed multiple copies different languages, fact always noted, followed stipulation versions different languages equally authentic. signatures parties' representatives follow end. When text treaty later reprinted, collection treaties currently effect, editor will often append dates respective parties ratified treaty effect party. Bilateral treaties concluded two states entities. possible, however, bilateral treaty two parties; consider instance bilateral treaties Switzerland European Union following Swiss rejection European Economic Area agreement. treaties seventeen parties. bilateral, not multilateral, treaties. parties divided two groups, Swiss "on one part" its member states "on part". treaty establishes rights obligations Swiss member states severally—it does not establish rights obligations amongst its member states. multilateral treaty concluded among several countries. agreement establishes rights obligations party every party. Multilateral treaties often regional. Treaties "mutual guarantee" international compacts, e.g., Treaty Locarno guarantees signatory against attack another. Reservations essentially caveats state's acceptance treaty. Reservations unilateral statements purporting exclude modify legal obligation its effects reserving state. included time signing ratification, i.e. party cannot add reservation already joined treaty". Originally, international law unaccepting treaty reservations, rejecting unless parties treaty accepted reservations. However, interest encouraging largest number states join treaties, permissive rule regarding reservations emerged. treaties expressly forbid reservations, generally permitted extent not inconsistent goals purposes treaty. When state limits its treaty obligations reservations, states party treaty option accept reservations, object them, object oppose them. state accepts fails act all, reserving state accepting state relieved reserved legal obligation concerns legal obligations accepting reservation does not change accepting state's legal obligations concerns parties treaty. state opposes, parts treaty affected reservation drop completely longer create legal obligations reserving accepting state, again concerns other. Finally, state objects opposes, legal obligations treaty two state parties whatsoever. objecting opposing state essentially refuses acknowledge reserving state party treaty all. three ways existing treaty amended. First, formal amendment requires State parties treaty ratification process again. re-negotiation treaty provisions long protracted, often parties treaty will not become parties amended treaty. When determining legal obligations states, one party treaty one party amended treaty, states will bound terms agreed upon. Treaties amended informally treaty executive council when changes procedural, technical change customary international law amend treaty, state behavior evinces new interpretation legal obligations treaty. Minor corrections treaty adopted procès-verbal; procès-verbal generally reserved changes rectify obvious errors text adopted, i.e. text adopted does not correctly reflect intention parties adopting it. international law international relations, protocol generally treaty international agreement supplements previous treaty international agreement. protocol amend previous treaty, add additional provisions. Parties earlier agreement not required adopt protocol. Sometimes made clearer calling "optional protocol", especially parties first agreement not support protocol. examples: United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change UNFCCC established framework development binding greenhouse gas emission limits, Kyoto Protocol contained specific provisions regulations later agreed upon. Treaties seen 'self-executing', merely becoming party puts treaty its obligations action. treaties non-self-executing require 'implementing legislation'—a change domestic law state party will direct enable fulfill treaty obligations. example treaty requiring legislation one mandating local prosecution party particular crimes. division two often not clear often politicized disagreements within government treaty, non-self-executing treaty cannot acted without proper change domestic law. treaty requires implementing legislation, state default its obligations failure its legislature pass necessary domestic laws. language treaties, law contract, interpreted when wording does not seem clear not immediately apparent applied perhaps unforeseen circumstance. Vienna Convention states treaties interpreted "in good faith" according "ordinary meaning given terms treaty context light its object purpose." International legal experts often invoke 'principle maximum effectiveness,' interprets treaty language having fullest force effect possible establish obligations parties. one party treaty impose its particular interpretation treaty upon parties. Consent implied, however, parties fail explicitly disavow initially unilateral interpretation, particularly state acted upon its view treaty without complaint. Consent parties treaty particular interpretation legal effect adding clause treaty commonly called 'authentic interpretation'. International tribunals arbiters often called upon resolve substantial disputes treaty interpretations. establish meaning context, judicial bodies review preparatory work negotiation drafting treaty final, signed treaty itself. One significant part treaty making signing treaty implies recognition side sovereign state agreement considered enforceable international law. Hence, nations careful terming agreement treaty. example, within United States, agreements states compacts agreements states federal government agencies government memoranda understanding. situation occur when one party wishes create obligation international law, party does not. factor work respect discussions North Korea United States security guarantees nuclear proliferation. terminology confusing treaty usually named something treaty, convention, protocol, simply agreement. Conversely legal documents Treaty Waitangi internationally considered documents domestic law. Treaties not necessarily permanently binding upon signatory parties. obligations international law traditionally viewed arising consent states, treaties expressly allow state withdraw long follows certain procedures notification. example, Single Convention Narcotic Drugs provides treaty will terminate if, result denunciations, number parties falls below 40. treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. Article Vienna Convention Law Treaties provides treaty silent whether not denounced rebuttable presumption cannot unilaterally denounced unless: shown parties intended admit possibility, right withdrawal inferred terms treaty. possibility withdrawal depends terms treaty its travaux preparatoire. has, example, held not possible withdraw International Covenant Civil Political Rights. When North Korea declared its intention Secretary-General United Nations, acting registrar, signatories ICCPR not overlooked possibility explicitly providing withdrawal, rather deliberately intended not provide it. Consequently, withdrawal not possible. practice, sovereignty, state purport withdraw treaty time, cease abide its terms. question whether lawful regarded success failure anticipate community acquiescence enforcement, is, states will react; instance, state impose sanctions war treaty violation. state party's withdrawal successful, its obligations treaty considered terminated, withdrawal one party bilateral treaty course terminates treaty. When state withdraws multi-lateral treaty, treaty will otherwise remain force among parties, unless, course, otherwise interpreted agreed upon remaining states parties treaty. party materially violated breached its treaty obligations, parties invoke breach grounds temporarily suspending obligations party treaty. material breach invoked grounds permanently terminating treaty itself. treaty breach does not automatically suspend terminate treaty relations, however. depends parties regard breach resolve respond it. Sometimes treaties will provide seriousness breach determined tribunal independent arbiter. advantage arbiter prevents party prematurely perhaps wrongfully suspending terminating its own obligations due another's alleged material breach. Treaties sometimes include provisions self-termination, meaning treaty automatically terminated certain defined conditions met. treaties intended parties temporarily binding set expire given date. treaties self-terminate treaty meant exist certain conditions. party claim treaty terminated, even absent express provision, fundamental change circumstances. change sufficient unforeseen, undermined “essential basis” consent party, radically transforms extent obligations parties, obligations performed. party cannot base claim change brought its own breach treaty. claim cannot used invalidate treaties established redrew political boundaries. several reasons otherwise valid agreed upon treaty rejected binding international agreement, involve problems created formation treaty. example, serial Japan-Korea treaties 1905, 1907 1910 protested; confirmed "already null void" 1965 Treaty Basic Relations Japan Republic Korea. party's consent treaty invalid given agent body without power state's domestic law. States reluctant inquire internal affairs processes states, "manifest violation" required "objectively evident State dealing matter". strong presumption exists internationally head state acted within proper authority. seems treaty ever actually invalidated provision. Consent invalid given representative ignored restrictions subject sovereign during negotiations, parties treaty notified restrictions prior signing. According preamble Law Treaties, treaties source international law. act lack thereof condemned international law, act will not assume international legality even approved internal law. means case conflict domestic law, international law will always prevail. Articles 46–53 Vienna Convention Law Treaties set ways treaties invalidated—considered unenforceable void international law. treaty will invalidated due either circumstances state party joined treaty, due content treaty itself. Invalidation separate withdrawal, suspension, termination addressed above, involve alteration consent parties previously valid treaty rather invalidation consent first place. state's consent invalidated erroneous understanding fact situation time conclusion, formed "essential basis" state's consent. Consent will not invalidated misunderstanding due state's own conduct, truth evident. Consent will invalidated induced fraudulent conduct party, direct indirect "corruption" its representative party treaty. Coercion either representative, state itself threat use force, used obtain consent state treaty, will invalidate consent. treaty null void violation peremptory norm. norms, unlike principles customary law, recognized permitting violations cannot altered treaty obligations. limited universally accepted prohibitions against aggressive use force, genocide crimes against humanity, piracy, hostilities directed civilian population, racial discrimination apartheid, slavery torture, meaning state legally assume obligation commit permit acts. United Nations Charter states treaties registered invoked enforced its judiciary organ, International Court Justice. done prevent proliferation secret treaties occurred 19th 20th century. Section 103 Charter states its members' obligations outweigh competing obligations treaties. adoption, treaties amendments follow official legal procedures United Nations, applied Office Legal Affairs, including signature, ratification entry force. function effectiveness, compared pre-Constitutional United States Federal government some, giving comparison modern treaty law historical Articles Confederation. Brazilian federal constitution states power enter treaties vested president treaties approved Congress articles 84, clause VIII, 49, clause practice, interpreted meaning executive branch free negotiate sign treaty, its ratification president contingent upon prior approval Congress. Additionally, Federal Supreme Court ruled that, following ratification entry force, treaty incorporated domestic law means presidential decree published federal register order valid Brazil applicable Brazilian authorities. Federal Supreme Court established treaties subject constitutional review enjoy hierarchical position ordinary legislation leis ordinárias, "ordinary laws", Portuguese. recent ruling Supreme Court 2008 altered scheme somewhat, stating treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy status above ordinary legislation, though remain beneath constitution itself. Additionally, per 45th amendment constitution, human rights treaties approved Congress means special procedure enjoy hierarchical position constitutional amendment. hierarchical position treaties relation domestic legislation relevance discussion whether latter abrogate former vice versa. Brazilian federal constitution does not supremacy clause effects one U.S. constitution, fact interest discussion relation treaties state legislation. United States, term "treaty" different, restricted legal sense exists international law. United States law distinguishes calls treaties executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, sole executive agreements. four classes equally treaties international law; distinct perspective internal American law. distinctions primarily concerning method approval. Whereas treaties require advice consent two-thirds Senators present, sole executive agreements executed President acting alone. treaties grant President authority fill gaps executive agreements, rather additional treaties protocols. finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval House Senate, either treaty signed President. Currently, international agreements executed executive agreement rather treaties rate 10:1. Despite relative ease executive agreements, President often chooses pursue formal treaty process executive agreement order gain congressional support matters require Congress pass implementing legislation appropriate funds, agreements impose long-term, complex legal obligations United States. example, deal United States, Iran countries not Treaty. article Bricker Amendment history relationship treaty powers Constitutional provisions.
