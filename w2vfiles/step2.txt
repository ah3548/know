self-governing irish state, having its own army police. treaty allowed northern ireland six north-eastern counties fermanagh, antrim, tyrone, londonderry, armagh down majority population protestant religion opt new state return united kingdom immediately. however, rather creating independent republic favoured nationalists, irish free state autonomous dominion british empire british monarch head

dáil, status irish free state dominion british commonwealth british retention so-called strategic treaty ports ireland's south coast remain occupied royal navy. issues cause split ira ultimately civil war. michael collins, republican leader led irish negotiating team, argued treaty gave "not ultimate freedom nations aspire develop, freedom achieve freedom". however, anti-treaty militants 1922 believed treaty deliver full irish independence. split treaty deeply personal. leaders sides close friends comrades during war independence. made disagreement treaty bitter. michael collins later éamon valera sent plenipotentiary negotiate treaty knew british not concede independent irish republic wanted collins blame compromise settlement. felt deeply betrayed when valera refused stand agreement plenipotentiaries negotiated david lloyd george winston churchill. valera, part, furious collins arthur griffith signed treaty without consulting irish cabinet instructed. dáil éireann parliament irish republic narrowly passed anglo-irish treaty votes 1922. following treaty's ratification, accordance article treaty, british-recognised provisional_government irish free state established. its authority treaty provide "provisional arrangement administration southern ireland during interval" establishment irish free state. accordance treaty, british government transferred "the powers machinery requisite discharge its duties". british government transferred powers, members provisional_government "signified writing [their] acceptance [the treaty]". upon treaty's ratification, valera resigned president republic failed re-elected even closer vote 60–58. challenged right dáil approve treaty, saying its members breaking oath irish republic. valera continued promote compromise whereby new irish free state "external association" british commonwealth rather member inclusion republics within commonwealth nations not formally implemented until 1949. early march, formed "cumann poblachta" republican association party remaining member sinn_féin commenced speaking tour republican province munster 1922. during tour, valera made controversial speeches carrick suir, lismore, dungarvan waterford, saying one point, "if treaty accepted, fight freedom on, irish people, instead fighting foreign soldiers, will fight irish soldiers irish government set irishmen." thurles, several days later, repeated imagery added ira "would wade blood soldiers irish government, perhaps members irish government freedom." letter irish independent march, valera accepted accuracy report comment "wading" blood, deplored newspaper published it. seriously, irish republican army ira officers against treaty, 1922 hoc army convention repudiated authority dáil accept treaty. contrast, minister defence, richard mulcahy, stated dáil conditions dublin prevented convention held, delegates selected voted ballot accept oath. anti-treaty ira formed own "army executive", declared real government country, despite result 1921 general election. april, minister defence, richard mulcahy, summarised alleged illegal activities ira men previous three months, whom described 'seceding volunteers', including hundreds robberies. yet fragmenting army police force ground following disintegration irish republican police disbanding royal irish constabulary ric. putting ten questions general mulcahy april, seán mcentee argued army executive acted continuously its own create republic 1917, unaltered constitution, fallen control dáil, that: "the body competent dissolve volunteer executive duly convened convention irish republican army" not dáil. accepting treaty abandoning republic, dáil majority effectively deserted army executive. reply, mulcahy rejected interpretation. then, debate defence, mcentee suggested supporting army executive "... even meant scrapping treaty terrible immediate war england, better civil war beginning present apparently." mcentee's supporters added robberies complained mulcahy caused lack payment provision dáil volunteers. collins established "army re-unification committee" re-unite ira organised election pact valera's anti-treaty political followers campaign jointly free state's first election 1922 form coalition government afterwards. tried reach compromise anti-treaty ira leaders agreeing republican-type constitution mention british monarchy new state. ira leaders liam lynch prepared accept compromise. however, proposal republican constitution vetoed british contrary terms treaty threatened military intervention free state unless treaty fully implemented. collins reluctantly agreed. completely undermined electoral pact pro- anti-treaty factions, went irish general election 1922 hostile parties, calling themselves sinn féin. pro-treaty sinn_féin party won election 239,193 votes 133,864 anti-treaty sinn féin. further 247,226 people voted parties, whom supported treaty. labour's 132,570 votes ambiguous regard treaty. according hopkinson, "irish labour union leaders, generally pro-treaty, made little attempt lead opinion during treaty conflict, casting themselves rather attempted peacemakers." election showed majority irish electorate accepted treaty foundation irish free state, valera, political followers ira continued oppose treaty. valera quoted saying, "the majority right wrong". meanwhile, leadership michael collins arthur griffith, pro-treaty provisional_government set establishing irish free state, organised national army replace ira new police force. however, envisaged new army built around ira, anti-treaty ira units allowed british barracks arms. practice, meant summer 1922, provisional_government southern ireland controlled dublin areas county longford ira units supported treaty. fighting ultimately broke when provisional_government tried assert its authority well-armed intransigent anti-treaty ira units around country particularly hardline group dublin. 1922, 200 anti-treaty ira militants, led rory o'connor, occupied four_courts several buildings central dublin, resulting tense stand-off. anti-treaty republicans wanted spark new armed confrontation british, hoped unite two factions ira against common enemy. however, determined free state viable, self-governing irish state, act rebellion put down rather british. arthur griffith favour using force against men immediately, michael collins, wanted costs avoid civil war, left four_courts garrison alone until late 1922. point, pro-treaty sinn_féin party secured large majority

hughes wilson, retired british army field marshal prominent security adviser prime minister northern ireland james craig, assassinated london role northern ireland. winston churchill assumed anti-treaty ira responsible killing warned collins use british troops attack four_courts unless provisional_government took action. fact, british cabinet actually resolved attack four_courts themselves june, operation involved tanks, howitzers aeroplanes. however, advice general nevil macready, commanded british garrison dublin, plan cancelled last minute. macready's argument british involvement united irish nationalist opinion against treaty, instead collins given last chance clear four_courts himself. final straw free state government june, when four_courts republican garrison kidnapped "ginger" o'connell, general new national army. collins, giving four_courts garrison final ultimatum leave building june, decided end stand-off bombarding four_courts garrison surrender. government appointed collins commander-in-chief national army. attack not opening shot war, skirmishes taken place pro- anti-treaty ira factions throughout country when british handing barracks. however, represented 'point return', when all-out war ipso facto declared civil war began. collins ordered mulcahy accept british offer two 18-pdr field artillery use new army free state, though general macready gave just 200 shells 10,000 store richmond barracks inchicore. anti-treaty forces four courts, possessed small arms, surrendered two days bombardment storming building

ammunition store accidentally ignited bombardment. pitched battles continued dublin until july, anti-treaty ira units dublin brigade, led oscar traynor, occupied o'connell street provoking week's street fighting: costing sides killed 280 wounded. among dead republican leader cathal brugha, made last stand exiting granville hotel. addition, free state took 500 republican prisoners. civilian casualties estimated numbered 250. when fighting dublin died down, free state government left firmly control irish capital anti-treaty forces dispersed around country, mainly south west. outbreak civil war forced pro- anti-treaty supporters choose sides. supporters treaty known "pro-treaty" free state army, legally national army, often called "staters" opponents. latter called themselves republicans known "anti-treaty" forces, irregulars, term preferred free state side. anti-treaty ira claimed defending irish republic declared 1916 during easter rising, confirmed first dáil invalidly

truce british fought neither war independence nor civil war. according richard mulcahy's estimate anti-treaty ira beginning war, 6,780 rifles 12,900 men. however, anti-treaty ira lacked effective command structure, clear strategy sufficient arms. rifles handful machine guns fighters armed shotguns handguns. took handful armoured cars british troops evacuating country. finally, artillery kind. result, forced adopt defensive stance throughout war. contrast, free state government managed expand its forces dramatically start war. michael collins commanders able build army able overwhelm opponents field. british supplies artillery, aircraft, armoured cars, machine guns, small arms, ammunition help pro-treaty forces. british delivered instance, 27,000 rifles, 250 machine guns eight

michael collins killed ambush anti-treaty republicans béal mbláth, near home county cork, 1922. collins' death increased bitterness free state leadership towards republicans probably contributed subsequent descent conflict cycle atrocities reprisals. arthur griffith, free state president, died brain haemorrhage ten days before, leaving free state government hands cosgrave free state army command general richard mulcahy. brief period, rising casualties among its troops its two principal leaders dead, looked free state collapse. however, winter set in, republicans found increasingly
