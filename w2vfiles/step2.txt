Upon fertilization implantation gestation occurs within female's uterus. zygote divides inside female's uterus become embryo period weeks months gestation becomes fetus. span time fully grown fetus birthed woman's body breathes independently infant first time. point modern cultures recognize baby person entitled full protection though jurisdictions extend various levels personhood earlier human fetuses remain uterus. Compared species human childbirth dangerous. Painful labors lasting hours uncommon sometimes lead death mother child both. relatively large fetal head circumference mother's relatively narrow pelvis. chances successful labor increased significantly during century wealthier countries advent medical technologies. contrast pregnancy natural childbirth remain hazardous ordeals developing regions world maternal death rates approximately times greater developed countries. developed countries infants typically pounds weight inches height birth. citation given However birth weight common developing countries contributes high levels infant mortality regions. Helpless birth humans continue grow years typically reaching sexual maturity years age. Females continue develop physically until around whereas male development continues until around human life span split number stages infancy childhood adolescence young adulthood adulthood age. lengths stages however varied across cultures time periods. Compared primates humans experience unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence body grows size. Chimpanzees example grow pronounced spurt. presence growth spurt probably necessary keep children physically small until psychologically mature. Humans species females undergo menopause. proposed menopause increases woman's overall reproductive success allowing invest time resources existing offspring turn children grandmother hypothesis rather continuing bear children age. various reasons including biological genetic causes women live average four years longer men—as global average life expectancy birth girl estimated years compared boy. significant geographical variations human life expectancy mostly correlated economic development—for example life expectancy birth Hong Kong years girls boys Swaziland primarily AIDS years sexes. developed world generally aging median around years. developing world median years. five Europeans years older twenty Africans years older. number centenarians humans years older world estimated United_Nations least person Jeanne Calment known reached years higher ages claimed substantiated. DIET Human nutrition Humans living Bali Indonesia preparing meal.

Varying available food sources regions habitation varying cultural religious norms human groups adopted range diets purely vegetarian primarily carnivorous. cases dietary restrictions humans lead deficiency diseases however stable human groups adapted dietary patterns genetic specialization cultural conventions nutritionally balanced food sources. human diet prominently reflected human culture development food science. Until development agriculture approximately years Homo_sapiens employed hunter-gatherer method sole means food collection. involved combining stationary food sources fruits grains tubers mushrooms insect larvae aquatic mollusks wild game hunted killed order consumed. proposed humans used fire prepare cook food time Homo erectus. Around thousand years humans developed agriculture substantially altered diet. change diet altered human biology spread dairy farming providing rich source food leading evolution ability digest lactose adults. Agriculture increased populations development cities increased population density wider spread infectious diseases. types food consumed prepared varied widely time location culture. general humans survive eight weeks without food depending stored body fat. Survival without water usually limited three four days. million humans every year causes directly indirectly related starvation. Childhood malnutrition common contributes global burden disease. However global food distribution even obesity among human populations increased rapidly leading health complications increased mortality developed developing countries. Worldwide billion people obese United_States people obese leading described obesity epidemic. Obesity caused consuming calories expended excessive weight gain usually caused energy-dense diet. BIOLOGICAL VARIATION Human genetic variation People warm climates often slender dark skinned Maasai Kenya. People cold climates tend lighter skinned Inuit women Canada. humans—not even monozygotic twins—are genetically identical. Genes environment influence human biological variation visible characteristics physiology disease susceptibly mental abilities. exact influence genes environment certain traits understood. current genetic archaeological evidence supports recent single origin modern humans East Africa first migrations placed years_ago. Compared great apes human gene sequences—even among African populations—are remarkably homogeneous. average genetic similarity humans times genetic_diversity within wild chimpanzee population entire human gene pool. human body's ability adapt different environmental stresses remarkable allowing humans acclimatize wide_variety temperatures humidity altitudes. result humans cosmopolitan species found almost regions world including tropical rainforests arid desert extremely cold arctic regions heavily polluted cities. species confined geographical areas limited adaptability. biological variation human species—with traits blood type cranial features color hair color type height build skin_color varying across globe. Human body types vary substantially. typical height adult human although varies significantly depending among things ethnic origin. Body size partly determined genes significantly influenced environmental factors diet exercise sleep patterns especially influence childhood. Adult height particular ethnic group approximately follows normal distribution. aspects genetic variation give clues human evolutionary history relevant medical research received particular attention. example genes allow adult humans digest lactose present high frequencies populations long histories cattle domestication suggesting natural selection having favored gene populations depend milk. hereditary diseases sickle cell anemia frequent populations malaria endemic throughout history—it believed gene gives increased resistance malaria among unaffected carriers gene. Similarly populations long time inhabited specific climates arctic tropical regions high altitudes tend developed specific phenotypes beneficial conserving energy environments—short stature stocky build cold regions tall lanky regions high lung capacities high altitudes. Similarly skin_color varies clinally darker skin around equator—where added protection sun's ultraviolet radiation thought give evolutionary advantage—and lighter skin tones closer poles. human skin hair determined presence pigments called melanins. Human skin_color range darkest brown lightest peach even nearly white colorless cases albinism. Human hair ranges color white blond brown black frequent. Hair color depends amount melanin effective blocking pigment skin hair hair melanin concentrations hair fading increased leading grey even white hair. researchers believe skin darkening adaptation evolved protection against ultraviolet solar radiation helps balancing folate destroyed ultraviolet radiation. Light skin pigmentation protects against depletion vitamin requires sunlight make. Skin pigmentation contemporary humans clinally distributed across planet general correlates level ultraviolet radiation particular geographic area. Human skin capacity darken response exposure ultraviolet radiation. STRUCTURE VARIATION Libyan Nubian Syrian Egyptian drawing unknown artist mural tomb Seti ancestors Native Americans Yanomami woman crossed Americas Northeast Asia genetic linguistic evidence links North Asian populations particularly East Siberia. older adult human male European Paris playing chess Jardins Luxembourg. Within human species greatest degree genetic variation exists males females. nucleotide genetic variation individuals across global populations greater genetic difference males females Although different nature clarification needed approaches genetic differentiation male chimpanzees women female chimpanzees. genetic difference sexes contributes anatomical hormonal neural physiological differences women although exact degree nature social environmental influences sexes completely understood. Males average heavier taller females. difference body types body organs systems hormonal levels sensory systems muscle mass sexes. average difference upper body strength lower body strength women. Women generally higher body percentage men. Women lighter skin population explained higher need vitamin synthesized sunlight females during pregnancy lactation. chromosomal differences females males chromosome related conditions disorders affect either women. conditional differences males females related chromosomes. Even allowing body weight volume male voice usually octave deeper female voice. Women longer life span almost every population around world. Males typically larger tracheae branching bronchi greater lung volume unit body mass. larger hearts higher blood cell count higher hemoglobin hence greater oxygen-carrying capacity. higher circulating clotting factors vitamin prothrombin platelets differences lead faster healing wounds higher peripheral pain tolerance. Females typically white blood cells stored circulating granulocytes lymphocytes. Additionally produce antibodies faster rate males. Hence develop fewer infectious diseases continue shorter periods. Ethologists argue females interacting females multiple offspring social groups experienced traits selective advantage. According Daly Wilson sexes differ human beings monogamous mammals less extremely polygamous mammals. given sexual_dimorphism closest relatives humans greater among humans human clade considered characterized decreasing sexual_dimorphism probably less competitive mating patterns. proposed explanation human sexuality developed common close relative bonobo exhibits similar sexual_dimorphism polygynandrous uses recreational reinforce social bonds reduce aggression. Humans genetically identical. extremely little variation human geographical populations variation does occur personal level within local areas populations. human genetic differentiation exists within randomly chosen local population Italians Koreans Kurds. randomly chosen Koreans genetically different Korean Italian. ethnic group contains human genetic_diversity world. Genetic data shows matter population groups defined people population group different people different population groups. Current genetic research demonstrated humans African continent genetically diverse. human genetic_diversity Africa anywhere else Earth. genetic structure Africans traced ancestral population clusters. Human genetic_diversity decreases native populations migratory distance Africa thought result bottlenecks during human migration. Humans lived Africa longest time allowed accumulation higher diversity genetic mutations populations. part Africa's population migrated continent bringing just part African genetic variety them. African populations harbor genetic alleles found places world. common alleles found populations outside Africa found African continent. Geographical distribution human variation complex constantly shifts time reflects complicated human evolutionary history. human biological variation clinally distributed blends gradually area next. Groups people around world different frequencies polymorphic genes. Furthermore different traits non-concordant different clinal distribution. Adaptability varies person person population population. efficient adaptive responses found geographical populations environmental stimuli strongest Tibetans highly adapted high altitudes clinal geographic genetic variation further complicated migration mixing human populations occurring prehistoric times. Human variation highly non-concordant genes cluster together inherited together. Skin hair color correlated height weight athletic ability. Human species share patterns variation geography. Skin color varies latitude certain people tall brown hair. statistical correlation particular features population different features expressed inherited together. Thus genes code superficial physical traits—such skin_color hair color height—represent minuscule insignificant portion human genome correlate genetic affinity. Dark-skinned populations found Africa Australia South Asia closely related other. Even within region physical phenotype related genetic affinity dark-skinned Ethiopians closely related light-skinned Armenians dark-skinned Bantu populations. Despite pygmy populations South East Asia Andamanese having similar physical features African pygmy populations short stature dark skin curly hair genetically closely related populations. Genetic variants affecting superficial anatomical features skin_color —from genetic perspective essentially meaningless—they involve hundred billions nucleotides person's DNA. Individuals morphology necessarily cluster lineage given lineage does include individuals trait complex. practices group endogamy allele frequencies cluster locally around groups lineages national ethnic cultural linguistic boundaries giving detailed degree correlation genetic clusters population groups when considering alleles simultaneously. Despite genetic boundaries around local populations biologically mark discrete groups humans. Human variation continuous clear points demarcation. large clusters relatively homogeneous people almost every individual genetic alleles several ancestral groups.
