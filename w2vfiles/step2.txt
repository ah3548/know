(wealth, age, hobbies), ethnicity often inherited status based society person lives. cases, adopted person moves society. membership ethnic group tends defined shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language dialect, symbolic systems religion, mythology ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, physical appearance. ethnic groups, derived historical founder population, often continue speak related languages share similar gene pool; grouped ethno-linguistic groups (e.g. germanic peoples, iranian peoples, slavic peoples, bantu peoples, turkic peoples, austronesian peoples, nilotic peoples, etc.) language shift, acculturation, adoption religious conversion, individuals groups leave ethnic group become part (except ethnic groups emphasizing racial purity membership criterion). ethnicity often used synonymously ambiguous terms nation people. english, connotation something exotic (cf. "white ethnic", "ethnic restaurant", etc.), generally related cultures recent immigrants, arrived founding population area established. depending source group identity emphasized define membership, following types (often mutually overlapping) groups identified: ethno-linguistic, emphasizing shared language, dialect script example: gaels ethno-national, emphasizing shared polity sense national identity example: iraqis ethno-racial, emphasizing shared physical appearance based genetic origins example: african americans ethno-regional, emphasizing distinct local sense belonging stemming relative geographic isolation example: south islanders ethno-religious, emphasizing shared affiliation particular religion, denomination sect example: sikhs cases instance, sense jewish peoplehood aspect determines membership. largest ethnic groups modern times comprise hundreds millions individuals (han chinese largest), smallest limited dozen individuals (numerous indigenous peoples worldwide). larger ethnic groups subdivided smaller sub-groups known variously tribes clans, time become separate ethnic groups themselves endogamy physical isolation parent group. conversely, formerly separate ethnicities merge form pan-ethnicity, eventually merge single ethnicity. whether division amalgamation, formation separate ethnic identity referred ethnogenesis. term ethnic derived greek word ἔθνος ethnos (more precisely, adjective ἐθνικός ethnikos, loaned latin ethnicus). inherited english language term concept folk, used alongside latinate people late middle english period. early modern english until mid-19th century, ethnic used mean heathen pagan sense disparate "nations" participate christian oikumene), septuagint used ethne ("the nations") translate hebrew goyim "the nations, non-hebrews, non-jews". greek term early antiquity (homeric greek) refer large group, host men, band comrades swarm flock animals. classical greek, term took meaning comparable concept expressed "ethnic group", mostly translated "nation, people"; hellenistic greek term tend become further narrowed refer "foreign" "barbarous" nations particular (whence later meaning "heathen, pagan"). 19th century, term used sense "peculiar race, people nation", return greek meaning. sense "different cultural groups", english "racial, cultural national minority group" arises 1930s 1940s, serving replacement term race earlier taken sense becoming deprecated association ideological racism. abstract ethnicity used "paganism" 18th century, express meaning "ethnic character" (first recorded 1953). term ethnic group first recorded 1935 entered oxford english dictionary 1972. depending context used, term nationality either used synonymously ethnicity, synonymously citizenship sovereign state). process results emergence ethnicity called ethnogenesis, term ethnological literature 1950. ethnography begins classical antiquity; early authors anaximander hecataeus miletus, herodotus laid foundation historiography ethnography ancient world. greeks time describe foreign nations developed concept "ethnicity", grouped name hellenes. herodotus (8.144.2) gave famous account defined greek (hellenic) ethnic identity day, enumerating shared descent (ὅμαιμον homaimon, blood"), shared language (ὁμόγλωσσον homoglōsson, "speaking language") shared sanctuaries sacrifices (greek: θεῶν ἱδρύματά κοινὰ θυσίαι theōn hidrumata koina thusiai) shared customs (greek: ἤθεα ὁμότροπα ēthea homotropa, "customs fashion"). whether ethnicity qualifies cultural universal extent dependent exact definition used. according "challenges measuring ethnic world: science, politics, reality", challenges measuring ethnic world: science, politics reality proceedings joint canada-united states conference measurement ethnicity, 1–3, 1992, joint canada-united states conference measurement ethnicity, department commerce, statistics canada, 1993, conference organised statistics canada united_states census bureau (april 1–3, 1992). social scientists, anthropologists fredrik barth eric wolf, consider ethnic identity universal. regard ethnicity product specific kinds inter-group interactions, rather essential quality inherent human groups. according thomas hylland eriksen, study ethnicity dominated distinct debates until recently. primordialist view, participant perceives ethnic ties collectively, externally given, even coercive, social bond. instrumentalist approach, hand, treats ethnicity primarily ad-hoc element political strategy, used resource interest groups achieving secondary goals instance, increase wealth, power, status. debate important point reference political science, although scholars' approaches fall poles. second debate "constructivism" "essentialism". constructivists view national ethnic identities product historical forces, often recent, even when identities presented old. essentialists view identities ontological categories defining social actors, result social action. according eriksen, debates superseded, especially anthropology, scholars' attempts respond increasingly politicised forms self-representation members different ethnic groups nations. context debates multiculturalism countries, united_states canada, large immigrant populations different cultures, post-colonialism caribbean south asia. weber maintained ethnic groups künstlich (artificial, i.e. social construct) based subjective belief shared gemeinschaft (community). secondly, belief shared gemeinschaft create group; group created belief. third, group formation resulted drive monopolise power status. contrary prevailing naturalist belief time, held socio-cultural behavioral differences peoples stemmed inherited traits tendencies derived common descent, called "race". influential theoretician ethnicity fredrik barth, whose "ethnic groups boundaries" 1969 described instrumental spreading usage term social studies 1980s 1990s. barth went further weber stressing constructed nature ethnicity. barth, ethnicity perpetually negotiated renegotiated external ascription internal self-identification. barth's view ethnic groups discontinuous cultural isolates, logical prioris people naturally belong. wanted part anthropological notions cultures bounded entities, ethnicity primordialist bonds, replacing focus interface groups. "ethnic groups boundaries", therefore, focus interconnectedness ethnic identities. barth writes: "... categorical ethnic distinctions depend absence mobility, contact information, entail social processes exclusion incorporation whereby discrete categories maintained despite changing participation membership course individual life histories." 1978, anthropologist ronald cohen claimed identification "ethnic groups" usage social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels indigenous realities: named ethnic identities accept, often unthinkingly, basic givens literature often arbitrarily, even worse inaccurately, imposed. way, pointed fact identification ethnic group outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, coincide self-identification members group. described first decades usage, term ethnicity often used lieu older terms "cultural" "tribal" when referring smaller groups shared cultural systems shared heritage, "ethnicity" added value able describe commonalities systems group identity tribal modern societies. cohen suggested claims concerning "ethnic" identity (like earlier claims concerning "tribal" identity) often colonialist practices effects relations colonized peoples nation-states. according paul james, formations identity often changed distorted colonization, identities made nothing: [c]ategorizations identity, even when codified hardened clear typologies processes colonization, state formation general modernizing processes, always full tensions contradictions. sometimes contradictions destructive, creative positive. social scientists thus focused how, when, different markers ethnic identity become salient. thus, anthropologist joan vincent observed ethnic boundaries often mercurial character. ronald cohen concluded ethnicity series nesting dichotomizations inclusiveness exclusiveness". agrees joan vincent's observation cohen's paraphrase) "ethnicity narrowed broadened boundary terms relation specific needs political mobilization. descent sometimes marker ethnicity, sometimes not: diacritic ethnicity salient depends whether people scaling ethnic boundaries down, whether scaling down depends generally political situation. different approaches understanding ethnicity used different social scientists when trying understand nature ethnicity factor human life society. examples approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism instrumentalism. "primordialism", holds ethnicity existed times human history modern ethnic groups historical continuity past. them, idea ethnicity closely linked idea nations rooted pre-weber understanding humanity divided primordially existing groups rooted kinship biological heritage. "essentialist primordialism" further holds ethnicity priori fact human existence, ethnicity precedes human social interaction basically unchanged theory sees ethnic groups natural, just historical. problems dealing consequences intermarriage, migration colonization composition modern multi-ethnic societies. "kinship primordialism" holds ethnic communities extensions kinship units, basically derived kinship clan ties choices cultural signs (language, religion, traditions) made exactly show biological affinity. way, myths common biological ancestry defining feature ethnic communities understood representing actual biological history. problem view ethnicity often case mythic origins specific ethnic groups directly contradict known biological history ethnic community. "geertz's primordialism", notably espoused anthropologist clifford geertz, argues humans general attribute overwhelming power primordial human "givens" blood ties, language, territory, cultural differences. geertz' opinion, ethnicity itself primordial humans perceive embedded experience world. "perennialism", approach primarily concerned nationhood tends nations ethnic communities basically phenomenon, holds nation, type social political organisation, immemorial "perennial" character. smith (1999) distinguishes variants: "continuous perennialism", claims particular nations existed long spans time, "recurrent perennialism", focuses emergence, dissolution reappearance nations recurring aspect human history."perpetual perennialism" holds specific ethnic groups existed continuously throughout history. "situational perennialism" holds nations ethnic groups emerge, change vanish course history. view holds concept ethnicity basically tool used political groups manipulate resources wealth, power, territory status particular groups' interests. accordingly, ethnicity emerges when relevant means furthering emergent collective interests changes according political changes society. examples perennialist interpretation ethnicity found barth, seidner ethnicity ever-changing boundaries groups people established ongoing social negotiation interaction. "instrumentalist perennialism", seeing ethnicity primarily versatile tool identified different ethnics groups limits time, explains ethnicity mechanism social stratification, meaning ethnicity basis hierarchical arrangement individuals. according donald noel, sociologist developed theory origin ethnic stratification, ethnic stratification "system stratification wherein relatively fixed group membership (e.g., race, religion, nationality) utilized major criterion assigning social positions". ethnic stratification different types social stratification, including stratification based socio-economic status, race, gender. according donald noel, ethnic stratification will emerge when specific ethnic groups brought contact another, when groups characterized high degree ethnocentrism, competition, differential power. ethnocentrism tendency look world primarily perspective one's culture, downgrade groups outside one's culture. sociologists, lawrence bobo vincent hutchings, origin ethnic stratification lies individual dispositions ethnic prejudice, relates theory ethnocentrism. continuing noel's theory, degree differential power present emergence ethnic stratification. words, inequality power among ethnic groups means "they unequal power able impose will upon another". addition differential power, degree competition structured along ethnic lines prerequisite ethnic stratification well. different ethnic groups competing common goal, power influence, material interest, wealth territory. lawrence bobo vincent hutchings propose competition driven self-interest hostility, results inevitable stratification conflict. "constructivism" sees primordialist perennialist views basically flawed, rejects notion ethnicity basic human condition. holds ethnic groups products human social interaction, maintained maintained valid social constructs societies. "modernist constructivism" correlates emergence ethnicity movement towards nation states beginning early modern period. proponents theory, eric hobsbawm, argue ethnicity notions ethnic pride, nationalism, purely modern inventions, appearing modern period world history. hold prior this, ethnic homogeneity considered ideal necessary factor forging large-scale societies. ethnicity important means people identify larger group. social scientists, anthropologists fredrik barth eric wolf, consider ethnic identity universal. regard ethnicity product specific kinds inter-group interactions, rather essential quality inherent human groups. processes result emergence identification called ethnogenesis. members ethnic group, whole, claim cultural continuities time, although historians cultural anthropologists documented values, practices, norms imply continuity past relatively recent invention. ethnic groups differ social groups, subcultures, interest groups social classes, emerge change historical periods (centuries) process known ethnogenesis, period several generations endogamy resulting common ancestry (which sometimes cast terms mythological narrative founding figure);

people moved state another, state conquered colonized peoples beyond national boundaries—ethnic groups formed people identified nation, lived state. multi-ethnic states result opposite events, either
