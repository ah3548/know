 ethnic group ethnicity category people identify based similarities, common ancestral, language, social, cultural national experiences. unlike social groups wealth, age, hobbies, ethnicity often inherited status based society person lives. cases, adopted person moves society. membership ethnic group tends defined shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language dialect, symbolic systems religion, mythology ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, physical appearance. ethnic groups, derived historical founder population, often continue speak related languages share similar gene pool; grouped ethno-linguistic groups e.g. germanic peoples, iranian peoples, slavic peoples, bantu peoples, turkic peoples, austronesian peoples, nilotic peoples, etc. language shift, acculturation, adoption religious conversion, individuals groups leave one ethnic group become part except ethnic groups emphasizing racial purity key membership criterion. ethnicity often used synonymously ambiguous terms nation people. english, connotation something exotic cf. "white ethnic", "ethnic restaurant", etc., generally related cultures recent immigrants, arrived founding population area established. depending source group identity emphasized define membership, following types often mutually overlapping groups identified: ethno-linguistic, emphasizing shared language, dialect script example: gaels ethno-national, emphasizing shared polity sense national identity example: iraqis ethno-racial, emphasizing shared physical appearance based genetic origins example: african americans ethno-regional, emphasizing distinct local sense belonging stemming relative geographic isolation example: south islanders ethno-religious, emphasizing shared affiliation particular religion, denomination sect example: sikhs cases instance, sense jewish peoplehood one aspect determines membership. largest ethnic groups modern times comprise hundreds millions individuals han chinese largest, smallest limited few dozen individuals numerous indigenous peoples worldwide. larger ethnic groups subdivided smaller sub-groups known variously tribes clans, time become separate ethnic groups themselves due endogamy physical isolation parent group. conversely, formerly separate ethnicities merge form pan-ethnicity, eventually merge one single ethnicity. whether division amalgamation, formation separate ethnic identity referred ethnogenesis. term ethnic derived greek word ἔθνος ethnos precisely, adjective ἐθνικός ethnikos, loaned latin ethnicus. inherited english language term concept folk, used alongside latinate people late middle english period. early modern english until mid-19th century, ethnic used mean heathen pagan sense disparate "nations" not yet participate christian oikumene, septuagint used ethne "the nations" translate hebrew goyim "the nations, non-hebrews, non-jews". greek term early antiquity homeric greek refer large group, host men, band comrades swarm flock animals. classical greek, term took meaning comparable concept expressed "ethnic group", mostly translated "nation, people"; hellenistic greek term tend become further narrowed refer "foreign" "barbarous" nations particular whence later meaning "heathen, pagan". 19th century, term used sense "peculiar race, people nation", return greek meaning. sense "different cultural groups", english "racial, cultural national minority group" arises 1930s 1940s, serving replacement term race earlier taken sense becoming deprecated due its association ideological racism. abstract ethnicity used "paganism" 18th century, express meaning "ethnic character" first recorded 1953. term ethnic group first recorded 1935 entered oxford english dictionary 1972. depending context used, term nationality either used synonymously ethnicity, synonymously citizenship sovereign state. process results emergence ethnicity called ethnogenesis, term use ethnological literature 1950. ethnography begins classical antiquity; early authors anaximander hecataeus miletus, herodotus ca. 480 laid foundation historiography ethnography ancient world. greeks time not describe foreign nations developed concept own "ethnicity", grouped name hellenes. herodotus 8.144.2 gave famous account defined greek hellenic ethnic identity day, enumerating shared descent ὅμαιμον homaimon, "of blood", shared language ὁμόγλωσσον homoglōsson, "speaking language" shared sanctuaries sacrifices greek: θεῶν ἱδρύματά κοινὰ καὶ θυσίαι theōn hidrumata koina kai thusiai shared customs greek: ἤθεα ὁμότροπα ēthea homotropa, "customs fashion". whether ethnicity qualifies cultural universal extent dependent exact definition used. according "challenges measuring ethnic world: science, politics, reality", challenges measuring ethnic world: science, politics reality proceedings joint canada-united states conference measurement ethnicity, 1–3, 1992, joint canada-united states conference measurement ethnicity, department commerce, statistics canada, 1993, conference organised statistics canada united_states census bureau 1–3, 1992. social scientists, anthropologists fredrik barth eric wolf, not consider ethnic identity universal. regard ethnicity product specific kinds inter-group interactions, rather essential quality inherent human groups. according thomas hylland eriksen, study ethnicity dominated two distinct debates until recently. one "primordialism" "instrumentalism". primordialist view, participant perceives ethnic ties collectively, externally given, even coercive, social bond. instrumentalist approach, hand, treats ethnicity primarily ad-hoc element political strategy, used resource interest groups achieving secondary goals as, instance, increase wealth, power, status. debate important point reference political science, although scholars' approaches fall two poles. second debate "constructivism" "essentialism". constructivists view national ethnic identities product historical forces, often recent, even when identities presented old. essentialists view identities ontological categories defining social actors, not result social action. according eriksen, debates superseded, especially anthropology, scholars' attempts respond increasingly politicised forms self-representation members different ethnic groups nations. context debates multiculturalism countries, united_states canada, large immigrant populations different cultures, post-colonialism caribbean south asia. max weber maintained ethnic groups künstlich artificial, i.e. social construct based subjective belief shared gemeinschaft community. secondly, belief shared gemeinschaft not create group; group created belief. third, group formation resulted drive monopolise power status. contrary prevailing naturalist belief time, held socio-cultural behavioral differences peoples stemmed inherited traits tendencies derived common descent, called "race". influential theoretician ethnicity fredrik barth, whose "ethnic groups boundaries" 1969 described instrumental spreading usage term social studies 1980s 1990s. barth went further weber stressing constructed nature ethnicity. barth, ethnicity perpetually negotiated renegotiated external ascription internal self-identification. barth's view ethnic groups not discontinuous cultural isolates, logical prioris people naturally belong. wanted part anthropological notions cultures bounded entities, ethnicity primordialist bonds, replacing focus interface groups. "ethnic groups boundaries", therefore, focus interconnectedness ethnic identities. barth writes: "... categorical ethnic distinctions not depend absence mobility, contact information, entail social processes exclusion incorporation whereby discrete categories maintained despite changing participation membership course individual life histories." 1978, anthropologist ronald cohen claimed identification "ethnic groups" usage social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels indigenous realities: ... named ethnic identities accept, often unthinkingly, basic givens literature often arbitrarily, even worse inaccurately, imposed. way, pointed fact identification ethnic group outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, not coincide self-identification members group. described first decades usage, term ethnicity often used lieu older terms "cultural" "tribal" when referring smaller groups shared cultural systems shared heritage, "ethnicity" added value able describe commonalities systems group identity tribal modern societies. cohen suggested claims concerning "ethnic" identity earlier claims concerning "tribal" identity often colonialist practices effects relations colonized peoples nation-states. according paul james, formations identity often changed distorted colonization, identities not made nothing: [c]ategorizations identity, even when codified hardened clear typologies processes colonization, state formation general modernizing processes, always full tensions contradictions. sometimes contradictions destructive, creative positive. social scientists thus focused how, when, why different markers ethnic identity become salient. thus, anthropologist joan vincent observed ethnic boundaries often mercurial character. ronald cohen concluded ethnicity series nesting dichotomizations inclusiveness exclusiveness". agrees joan vincent's observation cohen's paraphrase "ethnicity ... narrowed broadened boundary terms relation specific needs political mobilization. why descent sometimes marker ethnicity, sometimes not: diacritic ethnicity salient depends whether people scaling ethnic boundaries down, whether scaling down depends generally political situation. different approaches understanding ethnicity used different social scientists when trying understand nature ethnicity factor human life society. examples approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism instrumentalism. "primordialism", holds ethnicity existed times human history modern ethnic groups historical continuity far past. them, idea ethnicity closely linked idea nations rooted pre-weber understanding humanity divided primordially existing groups rooted kinship biological heritage. "essentialist primordialism" further holds ethnicity priori fact human existence, ethnicity precedes human social interaction basically unchanged it. theory sees ethnic groups natural, not just historical. problems dealing consequences intermarriage, migration colonization composition modern day multi-ethnic societies. "kinship primordialism" holds ethnic communities extensions kinship units, basically derived kinship clan ties choices cultural signs language, religion, traditions made exactly show biological affinity. way, myths common biological ancestry defining feature ethnic communities understood representing actual biological history. problem view ethnicity often not case mythic origins specific ethnic groups directly contradict known biological history ethnic community. "geertz's primordialism", notably espoused anthropologist clifford geertz, argues humans general attribute overwhelming power primordial human "givens" blood ties, language, territory, cultural differences. geertz' opinion, ethnicity not itself primordial humans perceive embedded experience world. "perennialism", approach primarily concerned nationhood tends nations ethnic communities basically phenomenon, holds nation, type social political organisation, immemorial "perennial" character. smith 1999 distinguishes two variants: "continuous perennialism", claims particular nations existed long spans time, "recurrent perennialism", focuses emergence, dissolution reappearance nations recurring aspect human history."perpetual perennialism" holds specific ethnic groups existed continuously throughout history. "situational perennialism" holds nations ethnic groups emerge, change vanish course history. view holds concept ethnicity basically tool used political groups manipulate resources wealth, power, territory status particular groups' interests. accordingly, ethnicity emerges when relevant means furthering emergent collective interests changes according political changes society. examples perennialist interpretation ethnicity found barth, seidner ethnicity ever-changing boundaries groups people established ongoing social negotiation interaction. "instrumentalist perennialism", seeing ethnicity primarily versatile tool identified different ethnics groups limits time, explains ethnicity mechanism social stratification, meaning ethnicity basis hierarchical arrangement individuals. according donald noel, sociologist developed theory origin ethnic stratification, ethnic stratification "system stratification wherein relatively fixed group membership e.g., race, religion, nationality utilized major criterion assigning social positions". ethnic stratification one different types social stratification, including stratification based socio-economic status, race, gender. according donald noel, ethnic stratification will emerge when specific ethnic groups brought contact one another, when groups characterized high degree ethnocentrism, competition, differential power. ethnocentrism tendency look world primarily perspective one's own culture, downgrade groups outside one's own culture. sociologists, lawrence bobo vincent hutchings, say origin ethnic stratification lies individual dispositions ethnic prejudice, relates theory ethnocentrism. continuing noel's theory, degree differential power present emergence ethnic stratification. words, inequality power among ethnic groups means "they unequal power one able impose its will upon another". addition differential power, degree competition structured along ethnic lines prerequisite ethnic stratification well. different ethnic groups competing common goal, power influence, material interest, wealth territory. lawrence bobo vincent hutchings propose competition driven self-interest hostility, results inevitable stratification conflict. "constructivism" sees primordialist perennialist views basically flawed, rejects notion ethnicity basic human condition. holds ethnic groups products human social interaction, maintained far maintained valid social constructs societies. "modernist constructivism" correlates emergence ethnicity movement towards nation states beginning early modern period. proponents theory, eric hobsbawm, argue ethnicity notions ethnic pride, nationalism, purely modern inventions, appearing modern period world history. hold prior this, ethnic homogeneity not considered ideal necessary factor forging large-scale societies. ethnicity important means people identify larger group. social scientists, anthropologists fredrik barth eric wolf, not consider ethnic identity universal. regard ethnicity product specific kinds inter-group interactions, rather essential quality inherent human groups. processes result emergence identification called ethnogenesis. members ethnic group, whole, claim cultural continuities time, although historians cultural anthropologists documented values, practices, norms imply continuity past relatively recent invention. ethnic groups differ social groups, subcultures, interest groups social classes, emerge change historical periods centuries process known ethnogenesis, period several generations endogamy resulting common ancestry sometimes cast terms mythological narrative founding figure; ethnic identity reinforced reference "boundary markers" characteristics unique group set apart groups. ethnicity theory says race social category one several factors determining ethnicity. criteria include: "religion, language, 'customs,' nationality, political identification". theory put forth sociologist robert based notion “culture”. theory preceded century biological essentialism dominant paradigm race. biological essentialism belief white european races biologically superior non-white races inherently inferior. view arose justify slavery africans genocide native americans society supposedly founded freedom all. notion developed slowly preoccupation scientists, theologians, public. religious institutions asked questions whether multiple genesis's polygenesis whether god created lesser races men. foremost scientists time took idea racial difference. inadvertently find white europeans superior. one method used measurement cranial capacity. ethnicity theory based assimilation model. park outlined four steps assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, assimilation. instead explaining marginalized status people color united_states inherent biological inferiority, instead failure assimilate american culture held people back. equal long dropped culture deficient compared white culture. michael omi howard winant's theory racial formation directly confronts ethnicity theory's premises practices. argue racial formation united_states ethnicity theory exclusively based immigration patterns white ethnic population not account unique experiences non-whites country. theory identities different stages immigration process contact, conflict, struggle, last best response, assimilation white ethnic communities. ethnicity paradigm neglects ways race complicate community's interactions basic social political structures, especially upon contact. assimilation shedding particular qualities native culture purpose blending host culture not work groups response racism discrimination others. moreover, once legal barriers achieving equality dismantled, problem racism became sole responsibility already disadvantaged communities. assumed black latino community not 'making it' standards set white ethnics, community not hold right values beliefs. stubbornly resisting dominant norms not want fit in. omi winant's critique ethnicity theory explains looking towards cultural defect source inequality ignores "concrete sociopolitical dynamics within racial phenomena operate u.s." words, buying approach effectively strips ability critically examine structural components racism encourages, instead, “benign neglect” social inequality. cases, especially involving transnational migration, colonial expansion, ethnicity linked nationality. anthropologists historians, following modernist understanding ethnicity proposed ernest gellner benedict anderson nations nationalism developing rise modern state system 17th century. culminated rise "nation-states" presumptive boundaries nation coincided ideally coincided state boundaries. thus, west, notion ethnicity, race nation, developed context european colonial expansion, when mercantilism capitalism promoting global movements populations time state boundaries clearly rigidly defined. 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy claim represent "nations." nation-states, however, invariably include populations excluded national life one reason another. members excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion basis equality, seek autonomy, sometimes even extent complete political separation own nation-state. conditions—when people moved one state another, one state conquered colonized peoples beyond its national boundaries—ethnic groups formed people identified one nation, lived state. multi-ethnic states result two opposite events, either recent creation state borders variance traditional tribal territories, recent immigration ethnic minorities former nation state. examples first case found throughout africa, countries created during decolonisation inherited arbitrary colonial borders, european countries belgium united kingdom. examples second case countries germany netherlands, ethnically homogeneous when attained statehood received significant immigration during second half 20th century. states united kingdom, france switzerland comprised distinct ethnic groups formation likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting termed "multicultural" societies especially large cities. states new world multi-ethnic onset, formed colonies imposed existing indigenous populations. recent decades feminist scholars notably nira yuval-davis drawn attention fundamental ways women participate creation reproduction ethnic national categories. though categories usually discussed belonging public, political sphere, upheld within private, family sphere great extent. women act not just biological reproducers 'cultural carriers', transmitting knowledge enforcing behaviours belong specific collectivity. women often play significant symbolic role conceptions nation ethnicity, example notion 'women children' constitute kernel nation defended times conflict, iconic figures britannia marianne. race ethnicity considered related concepts. ethnicity often assumed somewhat cultural identity group, often based shared ancestry, language cultural tradition, race assumed strictly biological classification, based dna bone structure. race controversial subject ethnicity, due its common political use. assumed that, based power relations, exist 'racialized ethnicities' 'ethnicized races'. ramón grosfoguel university california, berkeley argues 'racial/ethnic identity' one concept concepts race ethnicity cannot used separate autonomous categories. weber, race ethnicity primarily seen two aspects thing. around 1900 before, essentialist primordialist understanding ethnicity predominant: cultural differences peoples seen result inherited traits tendencies. weber's introduction view ethnicity social construct, race ethnicity became divided other. 1950, unesco statement, "the race question", signed internationally renowned scholars time including ashley montagu, claude lévi-strauss, gunnar myrdal, julian huxley, etc., suggested that: "national, religious, geographic, linguistic cultural groups not necessarily coincide racial groups: cultural traits groups demonstrated genetic connection racial traits. serious errors kind habitually committed when term 'race' used popular parlance, better when speaking human races drop term 'race' altogether speak 'ethnic groups'." 1982 anthropologist david craig griffith summed forty years ethnographic research, arguing racial ethnic categories symbolic markers different ways people different parts world incorporated global economy: opposing interests divide working classes further reinforced appeals "racial" "ethnic" distinctions. appeals serve allocate different categories workers rungs scale labor markets, relegating stigmatized populations lower levels insulating higher echelons competition below. capitalism not create distinctions ethnicity race function set off categories workers one another. is, nevertheless, process labor mobilization capitalism imparts distinctions effective values. according wolf, racial categories constructed incorporated during period european mercantile expansion, ethnic groupings during period capitalist expansion. writing usage term "ethnic" ordinary language great britain united states, 1977 wallman noted term 'ethnic' popularly connotes '[race]' britain, less precisely, lighter value load. north america, contrast, '[race]' commonly means color, 'ethnics' descendants relatively recent immigrants non-english-speaking countries. '[ethnic]' not noun britain. effect 'ethnics'; 'ethnic relations'. u.s., omb defines concept race outlined census not "scientific anthropological" takes account "social cultural characteristics ancestry", using "appropriate scientific methodologies" not "primarily biological genetic reference." sometimes ethnic groups subject prejudicial attitudes actions state its constituents. 20th century, people began argue conflicts among ethnic groups members ethnic group state resolved one two ways. some, jürgen habermas bruce barry, argued legitimacy modern states based notion political rights autonomous individual subjects. according view, state not acknowledge ethnic, national racial identity rather instead enforce political legal equality individuals. others, charles taylor will kymlicka, argue notion autonomous individual itself cultural construct. according view, states recognize ethnic identity develop processes particular needs ethnic groups accommodated within boundaries nation-state. 19th century saw development political ideology ethnic nationalism, when concept race tied nationalism, first german theorists including johann gottfried von herder. instances societies focusing ethnic ties, arguably exclusion history historical context, resulted justification nationalist goals. two periods frequently cited examples 19th century consolidation expansion german empire 20th century nazi germany. promoted pan-ethnic idea governments acquiring lands always inhabited ethnic germans. history late-comers nation-state model, arising near east south-eastern europe dissolution ottoman austro-hungarian empires, arising former ussr, marked inter-ethnic conflicts. conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, opposed them, regions world. thus, conflicts often misleadingly labelled characterized civil wars when inter-ethnic conflicts multi-ethnic state. ethnic groups africa number hundreds, generally having its own language dialect language culture. ethnic

serviceable coastlines, abundant natural resources, favorable climate; extent territory population large enough defend its territory; society aptitude sea commercial enterprise; government influence inclination dominate sea. mahan distinguished key region world eurasian context, namely, central zone asia lying 30° 40° north stretching asia minor japan. zone independent countries survived turkey, persia, afghanistan, china, japan. mahan regarded countries, located britain russia, "scylla charybdis". two monsters russia britain former mahan considered threatening fate central asia. mahan impressed russia's transcontinental size strategically favorable position southward expansion. therefore, found necessary anglo-saxon "sea power" resist russia. austro-hungarian historian emil reich 1854–1910 considered first having coined acceptance english early 1902 later 1904 book foundations modern europe. homer lea day saxon 1912 described entire anglo-saxon race faced threat german teuton, russian slav, japanese expansionism: "fatal" relationship russia, japan, germany "has assumed urgency natural forces coalition directed against survival saxon supremacy." dreadful dreibund". lea believed japan moved against far east russia against india, germans strike england, center british empire. thought anglo-saxons faced certain disaster militant opponents. sir halford mackinder's heartland theory initially received little attention outside geography, thinkers claim subsequently influenced foreign policies world powers. scholars look mackinder critical lenses accept organic strategist tried build foreign policy vision britain eurocentric analysis historical geography. formulation heartland theory set article entitled "the geographical pivot history", published england 1904. mackinder's doctrine geopolitics involved concepts diametrically opposed notion alfred thayer mahan significance navies coined term sea power world conflict. saw navy basis colombian era empire roughly 1492 19th century, predicted 20th century domain land power. heartland theory hypothesized huge empire brought existence heartland—which wouldn't need use coastal transoceanic transport remain coherent. basic notions mackinder's doctrine involve considering geography earth divided two sections: world island core, comprising eurasia africa; peripheral "islands", including americas, australia, japan, british isles, oceania. not periphery noticeably smaller world island, necessarily required sea transport function technological level world island—which contained sufficient natural resources developed economy. mackinder posited industrial centers periphery necessarily located widely separated locations. world island send its navy destroy one turn, locate its own industries region further inland periphery longer struggle reaching them, face well-stocked industrial bastion. mackinder called region heartland. essentially comprised central eastern europe: ukraine, western russia, mitteleuropa. heartland contained grain reserves ukraine, natural resources. mackinder's notion geopolitics summed when said: rules central eastern europe commands heartland. rules heartland commands world-island. rules world-island commands world. spykman follower critic geostrategists alfred mahan, halford mackinder. work based assumptions similar mackinder's, including unity world politics world sea. extends include unity air. spykman adopts mackinder's divisions world, renaming some: heartland; rimland analogous mackinder's "inner marginal crescent" intermediate region, lying heartland marginal sea powers; offshore islands continents mackinder's "outer insular crescent". spykman's theory, rimland separates heartland ports usable throughout year is, not frozen during winter. spykman suggested required attempts heartland nations particularly russia conquer ports rimland prevented. spykman modified mackinder's formula relationship heartand rimland inner crescent, claiming "who controls rimland rules eurasia. rules eurasia controls destinies world." theory traced origins containment, u.s. policy preventing spread soviet influence world_war truman doctrine. famous follower mackinder karl haushofer called mackinder's geographical pivot history "genius' scientific tractate." commented it: "never seen anything greater few pages geopolitical masterwork." mackinder located pivot, words haushofer, "one first solid, geopolitically geographically irreproachable maps, presented one earliest scientific forums planet royal geographic society london" haushofer adopted mackinder's heartland thesis view russian-german alliance powers mackinder saw major contenders control eurasia twentieth century. following mackinder suggested alliance soviet union and, advancing step beyond mackinder, added japan design eurasian bloc. 2004, centenary geographical pivot history, famous historian paul kennedy wrote: "right hundreds thousands troops eurasian rimlands administration constantly explaining why stay course, looks washington taking seriously mackinder's injunction ensure control geographical pivot history." two famous security advisers cold war period, henry kissinger zbigniew brzezinski, cared lest united_states lose its geopolitical focus eurasia and, first foremost, russia despite fall communism end ideological struggle. ideological cold warriors, turned convinced geopoliticians end cold war, wrote influential book subject 1990s—diplomacy kissinger 1994 grand chessboard: american primacy its geostrategic imperatives. anglo-american classical geopolitical theories revived. students geopolitics history, kissinger wrote diplomacy, uneasy approach hostile intentions disappeared traditional foreign policy considerations longer apply. "they argue russia, regardless govern it, sits astride territory halford mackinder called geopolitical heartland, heir one potent imperial traditions." united_states "maintain global balance power vis-à-vis country long history expansionism." russia, second geopolitical threat traditionally remained germany and, mackinder feared ninety years ago, its partnership russia. during cold war, kissinger argues, sides atlantic recognized that, "unless america organically involved europe, obliged involve itself later circumstances far less favorable sides atlantic. even true today. germany become strong existing european institutions cannot themselves strike balance germany its european partners. nor europe, even germany, manage itself russia…" country's interest germany russia fixate principal partner. raise fears condominium. without america, britain france cannot cope germany russia; "without europe, america turn island off shores eurasia." spykman's vision eurasia strongly confirmed: "geopolitically, america island off shores large landmass euraisa, whose resources population far exceed united states. domination single power either eurasia's two principal spheres—europe asia—remains good definition strategic danger america. cold war cold war. grouping capacity outstrip america economically and, end, militarily. danger resisted even dominant power apparently benevolent, intentions ever changed, america find itself grossly diminished capacity effective resistance growing inability shape events." main interest american leaders maintaining balance power eurasia having converted ideologist geopolitician, kissinger retrospect interpreted cold war geopolitical terms—an approach not characteristic works during cold war. now, however, stressed beginning cold war: "the objective moral opposition communism merged geopolitical task containing soviet expansion." nixon, added, geopolitical rather ideological cold warrior. three years kissinger's dilpomacy, brzezinski followed suit, launching grand chessboard: american primacy its geostrategic imperatives and, three years, geostrategic triad: living china, europe, russia. grand chessboard described american triumph cold war terms control eurasia: first time ever, "non-eurasian" power emerged key arbiter "eurasian" power relations. book states its purpose: "the formulation comprehensive integrated eurasian geostrategy therefore purpose book." although power configuration underwent revolutionary change, brzezinski confirmed three years later, eurasia megacontinent. spykman, brzezinski acknowledges that: "cumulatively, eurasia's power vastly overshadows america's." classical spykman terms, brzezinski formulized geostrategic "chessboard" doctrine eurasia, aims prevent unification megacontinent. "europe asia politically economically powerful…. follows that… american foreign policy must…employ its influence eurasia manner creates stable continental equilibrium, united_states political

greatest fear mahan, mackinder, homer lea, spykman greatest hope haushofer; traditionally, generation later greatest fear kissinger brzezinski greatest hope famous eurasianist, alexander dugin. regarding specific key-region—heartland, rimland, shutter-belt, east europe, introduced mackinder 1943 north american heartland—the dispute remained unresolved. mackinder stated not permanent time
