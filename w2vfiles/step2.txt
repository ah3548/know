"negative war aims" forestall prevent undesired outcomes. war aims change course conflict eventually morph "peace conditions" minimal conditions state cease wage particular war. currently dozens ongoing armed conflicts around world, deadliest syrian civil war. religious groups long formally opposed sought limit war second vatican council document gaudiem spes: "any act war aimed indiscriminately destruction entire cities extensive areas along population crime against god man himself. merits unequivocal unhesitating condemnation." anti-war movements existed every major war 20th century, including, prominently, world_war world_war ii, vietnam war. 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred response united_states invasion afghanistan iraq. protests opposing war afghanistan occurred europe, asia, united states. organizations stop war coalition, based united kingdom, worked campaigning against war. mexican drug war, estimated casualties 40,000 2006, recently faced fundamental opposition. 2011, movement peace justice started popular middle-class movement against war. won recognition president calderon, began war. scholarly agreement common motivations war. carl von clausewitz said, 'every age its own kind war, its own limiting conditions, its own peculiar preconceptions.' dutch psychoanalyst joost meerloo held that, "war often...a mass discharge accumulated internal rage where...the inner fears mankind discharged mass destruction." thus war sometimes means man's own frustration inability master own self expressed temporarily relieved via unleashing destructive behavior upon others. destructive scenario, others made serve scapegoat unspoken subconscious frustrations fears. durban john bowlby argued human beings inherently violent. aggressiveness fueled displacement projection person transfers grievances bias hatred against races, religions, nations ideologies. theory, nation state preserves order local society creating outlet aggression warfare. italian psychoanalyst franco fornari, follower melanie klein, thought war paranoid projective “elaboration” mourning. fornari thought war violence develop “love need”: wish preserve defend sacred object attached, namely early mother fusion her. adult, nations sacred objects generate warfare. fornari focused upon sacrifice essence war: astonishing willingness human beings die country, give bodies nation. despite fornari's theory man's altruistic desire self-sacrifice noble cause contributing factor towards war,few wars originated desire war among general populace. far often general population reluctantly drawn war its rulers. one psychological theory looks leaders advanced maurice walsh. argues general populace neutral towards war wars occur when leaders psychologically abnormal disregard human life placed power. war caused leaders seek war napoleon hitler. leaders often power times crisis when populace opts decisive leader, leads nation war. naturally, common people don't want war; neither russia nor england nor america, nor matter germany. but, all, leaders country determine policy always simple matter drag people along, whether democracy fascist dictatorship parliament communist dictatorship. ... people always brought bidding leaders. tell attacked denounce pacifists lack patriotism exposing country danger. several theories concern evolutionary origins warfare. two main schools: one sees organized warfare emerging mesolithic result complex social organization greater population density competition resources; sees human warfare ancient practice derived common animal tendencies, territoriality sexual competition. latter school argues warlike behavior patterns found primate species chimpanzees, ant species, group conflict general feature animal social behavior. proponents idea argue war, innate, intensified greatly developments technology social organization weaponry states. psychologist linguist steven pinker argued war-related behaviors naturally selected ancestral environment due benefits victory. argued order credible deterrence against groups individual level, important reputation retaliation, causing humans develop instincts revenge protecting group's individual's reputation "honor". crofoot wrangham argued warfare, defined group interactions "coalitions attempt aggressively dominate kill members groups", characteristic human societies. lacking "tend societies politically dominated neighbors". ashley montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing social factors childhood socialization important determining nature presence warfare. thus, argues, warfare not universal human occurrence appears historical invention, associated certain types human societies. montagu's argument supported ethnographic research conducted societies concept aggression seems entirely absent, e.g. chewong semai malay peninsula. low observed correlation warfare education, noting societies warfare commonplace encourage children aggressive. war seen growth economic competition competitive international system. view wars begin pursuit markets natural resources wealth. war linked economic development economic historians development economists studying state-building fiscal capacity. theory applied conflicts, counter arguments become less valid increasing mobility capital information level distributions wealth worldwide, when considering relative, not absolute, wealth differences fuel wars. extreme right political spectrum provide support, fascists particular, asserting natural right strong nation whatever weak cannot hold force. centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including presidents united_states u.s. generals, expressed support economic view war. marxist theory war quasi-economic states modern wars caused competition resources markets great imperialist powers, claiming wars natural result free market class system. part theory war will disappear once world revolution, over-throwing free markets class systems, occurred. marxist philosopher rosa luxemburg theorized imperialism result capitalist countries needing new markets. expansion means production possible corresponding growth consumer demand. workers capitalist economy unable fill demand, producers expand non-capitalist markets find consumers goods, hence driving imperialism. demographic theories grouped two classes, malthusian theories youth bulge theories. malthusian theories expanding population scarce resources source violent conflict. pope urban 1095, eve first crusade, spoke: land inhabit, shut sides sea mountain peaks, narrow large population; scarcely furnishes food enough its cultivators. hence murder devour one another, wage wars, among perish civil strife. let hatred, therefore, depart among you; let quarrels end. enter upon road holy sepulchre; wrest land wicked race, subject yourselves. one earliest expressions called malthusian theory war, wars caused expanding populations limited resources. thomas malthus 1766–1834 wrote populations always increase until limited war, disease, famine. according heinsohn, proposed youth bulge theory its generalized form, youth bulge occurs when percent males nation belong "fighting age" cohorts years age. will follow periods total fertility rates high 4–8 children per woman 15–29-year delay. heinsohn saw past "christianist" european colonialism imperialism, wellas today's islamist civil unrest terrorism results high birth rates producing youth bulges. among prominent historical events attributed youth bulges role played historically large youth cohorts rebellion revolution waves early modern europe, including french revolution 1789, effect economic depression upon largest german youth cohorts ever explaining rise nazism germany 1930s. 1994 rwandan genocide analyzed following massive youth bulge. youth bulge theory subjected statistical analysis world bank, population action international, berlin institute population development. youth bulge theories criticized leading racial, gender age discrimination. rationalism international relations theory framework. rationalism neorealism international relations operate assumption states international actors rational, seek best possible outcomes themselves, desire avoid costs war. game theory approach, rationalist theories posit actors bargain, better off war not occur, likewise seek understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. "rationalist explanations war", james fearon examined three rationalist explanations why countries engage war: issue indivisibilities incentives misrepresent information asymmetry commitment problems "issue indivisibility" occurs when two parties cannot avoid war bargaining, thing fighting cannot shared them, owned entirely one side other. "information asymmetry incentives misrepresent" occurs when two countries secrets individual capabilities, not agree either: win war them, magnitude state's victory loss. instance, geoffrey blainey argues war result miscalculation strength. cites historical examples war demonstrates, "war usually outcome diplomatic crisis cannot solved sides conflicting estimates bargaining power." thirdly, bargaining fail due states' inability credible commitments. within rationalist tradition, theorists suggested individuals engaged war suffer normal level cognitive bias, "as rational me". according philosopher iain king, "most instigators conflict overrate chances success, participants underrate chances injury...." king asserts "most catastrophic military decisions rooted groupthink" faulty, rational. rationalist theory focused around bargaining currently debate. iraq war proved anomaly undercuts validity applying rationalist theory wars. statistical analysis war pioneered lewis fry richardson following world_war recent databases wars armed conflict assembled correlates war project, peter brecke uppsala conflict data program. following subsections consider causes war system, societal, individual levels analysis. kind division first proposed kenneth waltz man, state, war often used political scientists then. several different international relations theory schools. supporters realism international relations argue motivation states quest security, conflicts arise inability distinguish defense offense, called security dilemma. within realist school represented scholars henry kissinger hans morgenthau, neorealist school represented scholars kenneth waltz john mearsheimer, two main sub-theories are: balance power theory: states goal preventing single state becoming hegemon, war result would-be hegemon's persistent attempts power acquisition. view, international system equal distribution power stable, "movements toward unipolarity destabilizing." however, evidence shown power polarity not actually major factor occurrence wars. power transition theory: hegemons impose stabilizing conditions world order, eventually decline, war occurs when declining hegemon challenged rising power aims preemptively suppress them. view, unlike balance-of-power theory, wars become probable when power equally distributed. "power preponderance" hypothesis empirical support. two theories not mutually exclusive, used explain disparate events according circumstance. liberalism relates international relations emphasizes factors trade, its role disincentivizing conflict will damage economic relations. realists respond military force sometimes least effective trade achieving economic benefits, especially historically not today. furthermore, trade relations result high level dependency, escalate tensions lead conflict. empirical data relationship trade peace mixed, moreover, evidence suggests countries war don't necessarily trade less other. diversionary theory, known "scapegoat hypothesis", suggests politically powerful use war diversion rally domestic popular support. supported literature showing outgroup hostility enhances ingroup bonding, significant domestic "rally effect" demonstrated when conflicts begin. however, studies examining increased use force function need internal political support mixed. u.s. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during presidencies several recent u.s. leaders supported diversionary theory. theories suggest differences people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, biases important determining whether conflicts hand. instance, proposed conflict modulated bounded rationality various cognitive biases, prospect theory. morality war subject debate thousands years. two principle aspects ethics war, according just war theory jus bellum jus bello. jus bellum right war, dictates unfriendly acts circumstances justify proper authority declaring war nation. six main criteria declaration just war: first, just war declared lawful authority; second, just righteous cause, sufficient gravity merit large-scale violence; third, just belligerent rightful intentions namely, seek advance good curtail evil; fourth, just belligerent reasonable chance success; fifth, war last resort; sixth, ends sought proportional means used. jus bello right war, set ethical rules when conducting war. two main principles proportionality discrimination. proportionality regards force necessary morally appropriate ends sought injustice suffered. principle discrimination determines legitimate targets war, specifically makes separation combatants, permissible kill, not. failure follow rules result loss legitimacy just-war-belligerent. just war theory foundational creation united nations international law's regulations legitimate war. fascism, ideals encompasses, pragmatism, racism, social darwinism, hold violence good. pragmatism holds war violence good serves ends people, without regard universal morality. racism holds violence good master race established, purge inferior race earth, both. social darwinism asserts violence sometimes necessary weed unfit society civilization flourish. broad archetypes general position ends justify means. lewis coser, u.s. conflict theorist sociologist, argued conflict provides function process whereby succession new equilibriums created. thus, struggle opposing forces, rather disruptive, means balancing maintaining social structure society. outline war general reference war-related lists interactive map battles fought around world last 4,000 years war zone safety travel guide wikivoyage republican refer to: advocate republic, form government not monarchy dictatorship, usually associated rule law republicanism, ideology support republics against monarchy;

objective outcome ceremonial occasion acknowledges parties defined relationships. late 19th century, treaties followed fairly consistent format. treaty typically begins preamble describing contracting parties joint objectives executing treaty, summarizing underlying events war. modern preambles sometimes structured single long sentence formatted multiple paragraphs readability, paragraphs begins verb desiring, recognizing, having, on. contracting parties' full names sovereign titles often included preamble, along full names titles representatives, boilerplate clause representatives communicated exchanged full powers i.e., official documents appointing act behalf respective states found good proper form. end preamble start actual agreement often signaled words "have agreed follows." preamble comes numbered articles, contain substance parties' actual agreement. article heading usually encompasses paragraph. long treaty further group articles chapter headings. modern treaties, regardless subject matter, usually contain articles governing final authentic copies treaty will deposited subsequent disputes interpretation will peacefully resolved. end treaty, eschatocol closing protocol, often signaled clause "in witness whereof" "in faith whereof," parties affixed signatures, followed words "done at," sites treaty's execution dates its execution. date typically written its formal, longest possible form. example, charter united nations "done city san francisco twenty-sixth day june, one thousand nine hundred forty-five." treaty executed multiple copies different languages, fact always noted, followed stipulation versions different languages equally authentic. signatures parties' representatives follow end. when text treaty later reprinted, collection treaties currently effect, editor will often append dates respective parties ratified treaty effect party. bilateral treaties concluded two states entities. possible, however, bilateral treaty two parties; consider instance bilateral treaties switzerland european union following swiss rejection european economic area agreement. treaties seventeen parties. bilateral, not multilateral, treaties. parties divided two groups, swiss "on one part" its member states "on part". treaty establishes rights obligations swiss member states severally—it does not establish rights obligations amongst its member states. multilateral treaty concluded among several countries. agreement establishes rights obligations party every party. multilateral treaties often regional. treaties "mutual guarantee" international compacts, e.g., treaty locarno guarantees signatory against attack another. reservations essentially caveats state's acceptance treaty. reservations unilateral statements purporting exclude modify legal obligation its effects reserving state. included time signing ratification, i.e. party cannot add reservation already joined treaty". originally, international law unaccepting treaty reservations, rejecting unless parties treaty accepted reservations. however, interest encouraging largest number states join treaties, permissive rule regarding reservations emerged. treaties expressly forbid reservations, generally permitted extent not inconsistent goals purposes treaty. when state limits its treaty obligations reservations, states party treaty option accept reservations, object them, object oppose them. state accepts fails act all, reserving state accepting state relieved reserved legal obligation concerns legal obligations accepting reservation does not change accepting state's legal obligations concerns parties treaty. state opposes, parts treaty affected reservation drop completely longer create legal obligations reserving accepting state, again concerns other. finally, state objects opposes, legal obligations treaty two state parties whatsoever. objecting opposing state essentially refuses acknowledge reserving state party treaty all. three ways existing treaty amended. first, formal amendment requires state parties treaty ratification process again. re-negotiation treaty provisions long protracted, often parties treaty will not become parties amended treaty. when determining legal obligations states, one party treaty one party amended treaty, states will bound terms agreed upon. treaties amended informally treaty executive council when changes procedural, technical change customary international law amend treaty, state behavior evinces new interpretation legal obligations treaty. minor corrections treaty adopted procès-verbal; procès-verbal generally reserved changes rectify obvious errors text adopted, i.e. text adopted does not correctly reflect intention parties adopting it. international law international relations, protocol generally treaty international agreement supplements previous treaty international agreement. protocol amend previous treaty, add additional provisions. parties earlier agreement not required adopt protocol. sometimes made clearer calling "optional protocol", especially parties first agreement not support protocol. examples: united nations framework convention climate change unfccc established framework development binding greenhouse gas emission limits, kyoto protocol contained specific provisions regulations later agreed upon. treaties seen 'self-executing', merely becoming party puts treaty its obligations action. treaties non-self-executing require 'implementing legislation'—a change domestic law state party will direct enable fulfill treaty obligations. example treaty requiring legislation one mandating local prosecution party particular crimes. division two often not clear often politicized disagreements within government treaty, non-self-executing treaty cannot acted without proper change domestic law. treaty requires implementing legislation, state default its obligations failure its legislature pass necessary domestic laws. language treaties, law contract, interpreted when wording does not seem clear not immediately apparent applied perhaps unforeseen circumstance. vienna convention states treaties interpreted "in good faith" according "ordinary meaning given terms treaty context light its object purpose." international legal experts often invoke 'principle maximum effectiveness,' interprets treaty language having fullest force effect possible establish obligations parties. one party treaty impose its particular interpretation treaty upon parties. consent implied, however, parties fail explicitly disavow initially unilateral interpretation, particularly state acted upon its view treaty without complaint. consent parties treaty particular interpretation legal effect adding clause treaty commonly called 'authentic interpretation'. international tribunals arbiters often called upon resolve substantial disputes treaty interpretations. establish meaning context, judicial bodies review preparatory work negotiation drafting treaty final, signed treaty itself. one significant part treaty making signing treaty implies recognition side sovereign state agreement considered enforceable international law. hence, nations careful terming agreement treaty. example, within united states, agreements states compacts agreements states federal government agencies government memoranda understanding. situation occur when one party wishes create obligation international law, party does not. factor work respect discussions north korea united_states security guarantees nuclear proliferation. terminology confusing treaty usually named something treaty, convention, protocol, simply agreement. conversely legal documents treaty waitangi internationally considered documents domestic law. treaties not necessarily permanently binding upon signatory parties. obligations international law traditionally viewed arising consent states, treaties expressly allow state withdraw long follows certain procedures notification. example, single convention narcotic drugs provides treaty will terminate if, result denunciations, number parties falls below 40. treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. article vienna convention law treaties provides treaty silent whether not denounced rebuttable presumption cannot unilaterally denounced unless: shown parties intended admit possibility, right withdrawal inferred terms treaty. possibility withdrawal depends terms treaty its travaux preparatoire. has, example, held not possible withdraw international covenant civil political rights. when north korea declared its intention secretary-general united nations, acting registrar, signatories iccpr not overlooked possibility explicitly providing withdrawal, rather deliberately intended not provide it. consequently, withdrawal not possible. practice, sovereignty, state purport withdraw treaty time, cease abide its terms. question whether lawful regarded success failure anticipate community acquiescence enforcement, is, states will react;
