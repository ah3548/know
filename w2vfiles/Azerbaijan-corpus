Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is an unrecognised  de facto  sovereign state, widely considered de jure  part of Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan  (i/ˌæzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn/  AZ-ər-by-JAHN; Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan), officially the Republic of Azerbaijan  (Azerbaijani: 
Azərbaycan Respublikası), is a country in the South Caucasus  region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and
Southeastern Europe.[5]  It is bounded by the Caspian Sea  to the east, Russia  to the north, Georgia  to the northwest, Armenia 
to the west and Iran  to the south. The exclave  of Nakhchivan  is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and
west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west.

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic  proclaimed its independence in 1918. The country was incorporated into the Soviet Union in
1920 as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.[6][7]  The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30
August 1991,[8]  prior to the official dissolution of the USSR  in December 1991. In September 1991, the Armenian majority of the
disputed Nagorno-Karabakh  region seceded to form the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.[9]  The region and seven adjacent districts
outside it  became de facto  independent with the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War  in 1994. These regions are internationally
recognized as part of Azerbaijan pending a solution to the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh, found through negotiations facilitated
by the OSCE.[10][11][12][13]

Azerbaijan is a unitary semi-presidential  republic. The country is a member state of the Council of Europe, the OSCE  and the 
NATO  Partnership for Peace  (PfP) program. It is one of six independent Turkic states, an active member of the Turkic Council 
and the TÜRKSOY  community. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries and holds membership in 38 international
organizations.[14]  It is one of the founding members of GUAM, the Commonwealth of Independent States  (CIS)[15]  and the 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. A member of the United Nations since 1992, Azerbaijan was elected to
membership in the newly established Human Rights Council  by the United Nations General Assembly  on 9 May 2006. Its term of
office began on 19 June 2006.[16]  Azerbaijan is also a member state of the Non-Aligned Movement, holds observer status in World
Trade Organization  and is a correspondent at the International Telecommunication Union.[14][17]

The Constitution of Azerbaijan  does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist
. However, the majority of the population consists of Shiite Muslims.[18]  Azerbaijan has a high level of human development  which
ranks on par with most Eastern European countries.[19]  It has a high rate of economic development[20]  and literacy,[21]  as well
as a low rate of unemployment.[22]

However, corruption in Azerbaijan is widespread, especially in the public service.[23][24]  The ruling party, the New Azerbaijan
Party, has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights abuses.[25][26]



ETYMOLOGY
Azerbaijan and its main citiesAccording to a modern etymology, the name of Azerbaijan derives from that of Atropates,[27][28]  a Persian[29][30][31]  satrap 
under the Achaemenid Empire, who was later reinstated as the satrap of Media  under Alexander the Great.[32][33]  The original
etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once-dominant Zoroastrian  religion. In the Avesta, Frawardin Yasht 
("Hymn to the Guardian Angels"), there is a mention of âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide, which literally translates from 
Avestan  as "we worship the Fravashi  of the holy Atropatene."[34]

Atropates  ruled over the region of Atropatene  (present Iranian Azerbaijan). The name "Atropates" itself is the Greek
transliteration of an Old Iranian, probably Median, compounded name with the meaning "Protected by the (Holy) Fire" or "The Land
of the (Holy) Fire".[35]  The Greek name was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus  and Strabo. Over the span of millennia the name
evolved to Āturpātākān  (Middle Iranian) then to Ādharbādhagān, Ādharbāyagān, Āzarbāydjān  (New Persian) and present-day 
Azerbaijan. Ultimately, the name Azerbaijan  comes from Azar-Payegan. This word is translatable as Guardian of Fire, "The
Treasury" and "The Treasurer" of fire  or "The Land of Fire"[35]  in Modern Persian.[36]  The name was changed to Azerbaijan 
following the Arab conquest in the 7th century AD; Arabic  lacked the letters G  and P, so Arabic speakers modified the spelling
of Azer-payegan.

In 1918, the Musavat government  adopted the name "Azerbaijan" for the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which was
proclaimed on 27 May 1918,[37]  for political reasons,[38][39]  even though the name of "Azerbaijan" had always been used to refer
to the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran.[40][41][42]  Thus, until 1918, when the Musavat regime decided to name
the newly independent state Azerbaijan, this designation had been used exclusively to identify the Iranian province of Azerbaijan.

HISTORY
Main article: History of AzerbaijanANTIQUITY
Further information: Atropatene  and Caucasian AlbaniaPetroglyphs  in Gobustan  dating back to 10,000 BC indicating a thriving
culture. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site  considered to be of "outstanding universal value".The earliest evidence of human
settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age  and is related to the Guruchay culture  of the Azykh
Cave.[44]  The Upper Paleolithic  and late Bronze Age  cultures are attested in the caves of Tağılar, Damcılı, Zar, Yataq-yeri and
in the necropolises  of Leylatepe and Saraytepe.

Early settlements included the Scythians  in the 9th century BC.[35]  Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes  came to dominate the
area to the south of the Aras.[33]  The Medes forged a vast empire between 900–700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenid
Empire  around 550 BC. The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism.[45]  Later it became
part of Alexander the Great's Empire  and its successor, the Seleucid Empire. During this period, Zoroastrianism spread in the
Caucasus and Atropatene. Caucasian Albanians, the original inhabitants of northeastern Azerbaijan, ruled that area from around the
4th century BC, and established an independent kingdom.

In the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, following the overthrow of the Achaemenid Empire, the southwestern part of modern Azerbaijan was
part of the Kingdom of Armenia ruled by the Orontid Dynasty; between the years 189 BC and 428 AD the western half of modern
Azerbaijan, including the exclave of Nakhchivan, were included into the Kingdom of Greater Armenia  ruled by Armenia's Artaxiad 
and Arsacid  dynasties,[46][47]  the latter itself a branch of the eponymous Arsacid dynasty of Parthia.

After the partition of the Kingdom of Armenia  by Iran  and Byzantium  in 387 AD, the provinces of Artsakh  and Utik, which had an
ethnically mixed population, passed to Caucasian Albania.[48][49]

FEUDAL ERA
The Maiden Tower  and The Palace of the Shirvanshahs  in Old Baku  is a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in the 11th–12th century.
The Iranian Sassanids  turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state  in AD 252, while King Urnayr  officially adopted Christianity
as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite Sassanid rule, Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century,
while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran, and retained its monarchy.[32]

In the first half of the 7th century AD, the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate  repulsed both the Sassanids and Byzantines from the
Caucasus and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after Christian resistance, led by King Javanshir, was suppressed in 667
AD. Caucasian Albania however, had already come under nominal Muslim rule through the Muslim conquest of Iran, as it was part of
the Sassanid territory upon advent of the Muslim conquest. The power vacuum left by the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate  was
filled by numerous local dynasties such as the Sallarids, Sajids, Shaddadids, Rawadids  and Buyids. At the beginning of the 11th
century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of Turkic  Oghuz  tribes from Central Asia. The first of these Turkic
dynasties established was the Seljuqs, who entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067.

The pre-Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijani Republic spoke several Indo-European and Caucasian
languages, among them Armenian[50][51]  [52][53][54]  and an Iranian language  called the Old Azari language, which was gradually
replaced by a Turkic language, the early precursor of the Azerbaijani language  of today.[55]  To distinguish it from the Turkic
Azerbaijani or Azeri language, this Iranian language, is designated as the Azari language (or Old Azari language), because the
Turkic language and people are also designated as "Azarbaijani" or "Azari" in the Persian language. However some linguists have
also designated the Tati dialects  of Iranian Azerbaijan  and the Republic of Azerbaijan, like those spoken by the Tats, as a
remnant of Azari.[56][57]  Locally, the possessions of the subsequent Seljuq Empire  were ruled by Atabegs, technically vassals of
the Seljuq sultans, but sometimes de facto  rulers themselves. Under the Seljuq Turks, local poets such as Nizami Ganjavi  and 
Khagani Shirvani  gave rise to a blossoming of Persian literature  on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan.

The next ruling state of the Jalayirids  was short-lived and fell as a conquest of Timur.

The local dynasty of the Shirvanshahs  became a vassal  state of Timur's Empire, and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the
 Golden Horde  Tokhtamysh. Following Timur's death, two independent and rival states emerged: Kara Koyunlu  and Ak Koyunlu. The
Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861 until 1539. During their
conquest and persecution by the Iranian Safavids  in 1501, the last dynasty imposed Shia Islam  upon the formerly Sunni 
population,[58][59][60]  as it did over its territories in modern-day Iran, as it was battling against the Sunni Ottoman Empire.
[61]  This, in combination with another series of events, the Safavids laid the foundation for the fact that Iran and the
contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan are the only Shia-majority countries ever since.[62]  Despite efforts of the Safavids, the
Ottomans briefly managed to occupy swaths of present-day Azerbaijan twice over the centuries. Also, Baku and its environs were
briefly managed by the Russians in the early 18th century as a consequence of the Russo-Persian War. Despite these very brief
intermissions by Safavid Iran's neighboring rivals, the land of what is nowadays Azerbaijan remained under intermittent  Iranian 
rule from the earliest advent of the Safavids up to the course of the 19th century.

MODERN ERA

Territories of the Northern and Southern Khanates (and Sultanates) in the 18th–19th centuries.[63]After the Safavids, the area was ruled by the Iranian dynasties of Afshar  and Zand  and briefly by the Qajars, until the latter
was eventually forced to cede it to the Russian Empire in the course of the 19th century. However, self-ruling khanates  with
various forms of independence[64][65][66][67][68]  emerged in the area, especially following the collapse of the Zand dynasty and
in the early Qajar era. These khanates, though often self-ruling, were vassals  and subjects  of the Iranian shah.[69]  The
khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West.[70]  From the late
18th century on, Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the
south, namely Iran and Turkey.[71]  Following a chain of events that started with the re-subjugation of Georgia into Iran  in
1795, Russia would now actively contest and battle with the latter over possession of the Caucasus region which was, for the most
part, in the hands of Iran.[72]  The successful Russian campaigns in the later stages of the Russo-Persian War (1804–13)  were
concluded with the Treaty of Gulistan, in which the shah's claims to some of the Khanates of the Caucasus were dismissed by Russia
on the ground that they had been de facto  independent long before their Russian occupation.[73]

The siege of Ganja Fortress in 1804  during the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)  by Russian forces under the leadership of General 
Pavel Tsitsianov.Following Qajar Iran's loss in the 1804–1813 war, it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates,
along with Georgia and Dagestan to the Russian Empire, per the Gulistan  treaty.[74]

The area to the north of the river Aras, amongst which territory lies the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, was Iranian
territory until it was occupied by Russia in the 19th century.[6][75][76][77][78][79]  Under the Treaty of Turkmenchay  which
ended the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), Qajar Iran  was forced to recognize Russian sovereignty over the Erivan Khanate, the 
Nakhchivan Khanate  and the remainder of the Lankaran Khanate,[74]  comprising the last parts of the soil of the contemporary
Azerbaijani Republic that were still in Iranian hands. After incorporation of all Caucasian territories from Iran into Russia, the
new border between the two was set at the Aras River, which, upon the Soviet Union's disintegration, subsequently became part of
the border between Iran and the Azerbaijan Republic.

Qajar Iran was forced to cede its Caucasian territories to Russia in the 19th century, which thus included the territory of the
modern-day Azerbaijan Republic, while as a result of that cession, the Azerbaijani ethnic group  is nowadays parted between two
nations: Iran and Azerbaijan.[80]  Furthermore, the number of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran far outnumber those in neighbouring
Azerbaijan.

After the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I, the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic  was
declared, constituting what are the present-day republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia.

It was followed by the March Days  massacres[81][82][83]  that took place between 30 March and 2 April 1918 in the city of Baku 
and adjacent areas of the Baku Governorate  of the Russian Empire.[84]  When the republic dissolved in May 1918, the leading 
Musavat  party declared independence as the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic  (ADR), adopting the name of "Azerbaijan" for the new
republic; a name that prior to the proclamation of the ADR was solely used to refer to the adjacent northwestern region of
contemporary Iran.[40][41][42]  The ADR was the first modern parliamentary republic  in the Muslim world.[6][85][86]  Among the
important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to
grant women equal political rights with men.[85]  Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State
University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Muslim East.[85]

Map presented by delegation from Azerbaijan to Paris Peace Conference  in 1919.By March 1920, it was obvious that Soviet Russia
would attack Baku. Vladimir Lenin  said that the invasion was justified as Soviet Russia  could not survive without Baku's oil.
[87][88]  Independent Azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the Bolshevik  11th Soviet Red Army  invaded it, establishing the 
Azerbaijan SSR  on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian
revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh, Azerbaijanis did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily.
As many as 20,000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.[89]

On 13 October 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the 
Treaty of Kars. The previously independent Naxicivan SSR would also become an autonomous ASSR within the Azerbaijan SSR by the
treaty of Kars. On the other hand, Armenia was awarded the region of Zangezur  and Turkey agreed to return Gyumri  (then known as
Alexandropol).

During World War II, Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the Soviet Union, with 80 percent of the
Soviet Union's oil on the Eastern Front  being supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  in February
1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry  of Azerbaijan were awarded orders and medals. 
Operation Edelweiss  carried out by the German Wehrmacht  targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy (petroleum) dynamo
of the USSR.[6]  A fifth of all Azerbaijanis fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945. Approximately 681,000 people with
over 100,000 of them women went to the front, while the total population of Azerbaijan was 3.4 million at the time.[90]  Some
250,000 people from Azerbaijan were killed on the front. More than 130 Azerbaijanis were named Heroes of the Soviet Union.
Azerbaijani Major-General Azi Aslanov  was twice awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union.[91]

REPUBLIC ERA
Red Army  paratroops  during the Black January  tragedy in 1990.Following the politics of glasnost, initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the
Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh,[92]  an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in
response to Moscow's indifference to already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which culminated
in Black January  in Baku.[93]  Later in 1990, the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR  dropped the words "Soviet Socialist"
from the title, adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic and restored flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic
Republic as the state flag.[94]  On 18 October 1991, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence which
was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991, when the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December 1991.
[94]

The early years of independence were overshadowed by the Nagorno-Karabakh war  with the ethnic Armenian majority of
Nagorno-Karabakh backed by Armenia.[95]  By the end of hostilities in 1994, Armenians controlled up to 14–16 percent of
Azerbaijani territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh itself.[96][97]  During the war many atrocities were committed including the 
massacre  at Malibeyli and Gushchular, the Garadaghly, Agdaban  and the Khojaly massacres.[98][99]  Furthermore, an estimated
30,000 people had been killed and more than a million people had been displaced.[100]  Four United Nations Security Council 
Resolutions (822, 853, 874, and 884) demand for "the immediate withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of
Azerbaijan."[101]  Many Russians and Armenians left Azerbaijan during the 1990s.[102]  According to the 1970 census, there were
510,000 ethnic Russians  and 484,000 Armenians in Azerbaijan.[103]

In 1993, democratically elected president Abulfaz Elchibey  was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Surat
Huseynov, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev.[104]  In 1994, Surat
Huseynov, by that time a prime minister, attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev, but Huseynov was arrested and
charged with treason.[105]  A year later, in 1995, another coup  was attempted against Aliyev, this time by the commander of the 
OMON  special unit, Rovshan Javadov. The coup was averted, resulting in the killing of the latter and disbanding of Azerbaijan's
OMON units.[106][107]  At the same time, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy.[108]  In
October 1998, Aliyev was reelected for a second term. Despite the much improved economy, particularly with the exploitations of 
Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field  and Shah Deniz gas field, Aliyev's presidency was criticized due to suspected vote fraud and
corruption.[109]

Ilham Aliyev, the son of Heydar Aliyev, assumed as the chairmen of the New Azerbaijan Party  as well as the office of presidency
when his father died in 2003. He was reelected to a third term  as president in October 2013. He then launched a crackdown on
opposition elements. In November, he put two prominent opponents on trial for inciting riots ten months earlier: Ilgar Mammadov,
the chairman of the opposition Republican Alternative (REAL); and Ilgar Mammadov, the deputy chairman of the New Equality Party
(Musavat). In addition the dissident Islamic theologian Taleh Bagirzada was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. The opposition
newspaper Azadiq  was closed down. Three men were sentenced to life in prison on charges of plotting attacks in Baku in a
conspiracy with Iran.[110]

GEOGRAPHY

of Azerbaijan, and National parks of AzerbaijanSee also: Extreme points of AzerbaijanCaucasus Mountains  in northern Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan is in the South Caucasus  region of Eurasia, straddling Western Asia  and Eastern Europe. It lies between latitudes 38° 
 and 42° N, and longitudes 44°  and 51° E. The total length of Azerbaijan's land borders  is 2,648 km (1,645 mi), of which
1007 kilometers are with Armenia, 756 kilometers with Iran, 480 kilometers with Georgia, 390 kilometers with Russia and
15 kilometers with Turkey.[111]  The coastline  stretches for 800 km (497 mi), and the length of the widest area of the
Azerbaijani section of the Caspian Sea is 456 km (283 mi).[111]  The territory of Azerbaijan extends 400 km (249 mi) from north to
south, and 500 km (311 mi) from west to east.

Three physical features dominate Azerbaijan: the Caspian Sea, whose shoreline forms a natural boundary to the east; the Greater
Caucasus  mountain range to the north; and the extensive flatlands at the country's center. There are also three mountain ranges,
the Greater and Lesser Caucasus, and the Talysh Mountains, together covering approximately 40 percent of the country.[112]  The
highest peak of Azerbaijan is mount Bazardüzü  (4,466 m), while the lowest point lies in the Caspian Sea (−28 m). Nearly half of
all the mud volcanoes  on Earth are concentrated in Azerbaijan, these volcanoes  were also among nominees for the New7Wonders of
Nature.[113]

The main water sources are surface waters. However, only 24 of the 8,350 rivers are greater than 100 km (62 mi) in length.[112] 
All the rivers drain into the Caspian Sea in the east of the country.[112]  The largest lake is Sarysu  (67 km²), and the longest
river is Kur  (1,515 km), which is transboundary. Azerbaijan's four main islands in the Caspian Sea have a combined area of over
thirty square kilometers.

Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the Azerbaijani government  has taken drastic measures to preserve the environment
of Azerbaijan. But national protection of the environment started to truly improve after 2001 when the state budget increased due
to new revenues provided by the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight
percent of the country's territory. Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the
budget earmarked for environmental protection.[114]

LANDSCAPE
Main articles: Orography of Azerbaijan, Climate of Azerbaijan, and Water bodies of AzerbaijanMount Bazarduzu, the highest peak of
Azerbaijan, as seen from Mount Shahdagh
The landscape of Khinalug valley.Azerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes. Over half of Azerbaijan's land mass consists
of mountain ridges, crests, yailas, and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400–1000 meters (including the Middle and
Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120 meters, and others from
0–50 meters and up (Qobustan, Absheron). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consist of plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within
the Caucasus region vary from about −28 meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466 meters (Bazardüzü peak).[115]

The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold arctic  air masses  of Scandinavian anticyclone,
temperate of Siberian  anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone.[116]  Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air
masses enter the country.[116]  The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from
the north. That leads to the formation of subtropical climate  on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and
foothills are characterized by high solar radiation  rates.

Nine out of 11 existing climate zones  are present in Azerbaijan.[117]  Both the absolute minimum temperature ( −33 °C or −27.4 °F 
 ) and the absolute maximum temperature ( 46 °C or 114.8 °F  ) were observed in Julfa  and Ordubad.[117]  The maximum annual 
precipitation  falls in Lankaran  (1,600 to 1,800 mm or 63 to 71 in) and the minimum in Absheron (200 to 350 mm or 7.9 to
13.8 in).[117]

Murovdag  is the highest mountain range  in the Lesser Caucasus.Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of
Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is
particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually
changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds
are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with
approximately 100,000 cubic metres (3,531,467 cubic feet) per year of water per square kilometer.[117]  All big water reservoirs 
are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the Caspian Sea basin.

There are 8,350 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Only 24 rivers are over 100 kilometers long.[118]  The Kura  and Aras 
 are the most popular rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the Kura-Aras Lowland. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian
Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and Talysh Mountains  and run along the Samur–Devechi and
Lankaran lowlands.

Yanar Dag, translated as "burning mountain", is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the Absheron
Peninsula  on the Caspian Sea  near Baku, which itself is known as the "land of fire." Flames jet out into the air from a thin,
porous sandstone layer. It is a tourist attraction to visitors to the Baku area.

BIODIVERSITY
Main article: Wildlife of AzerbaijanFurther information: Fauna of Azerbaijan  and Flora of Azerbaijan
The Karabakh horse  is the national animal of Azerbaijan.The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in
Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones
survived up to the present times. The first information on the animal kingdom of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of
naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century.[112]  Unlike fauna, the concept of animal kingdom covers not only the types of
animals, but also the number of individual species.

There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles
which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan.[112]  The national animal of Azerbaijan is the Karabakh horse, a
mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed,
elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. However today the horse is
an endangered species.[119]

Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of higher plants. Due to the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is
much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus.[120]  About 67 percent of the
species growing in the whole Caucasus  can be found in Azerbaijan.

POLITICS

The son of former President Heydar Aliyev, Ilham Aliyev  succeeded his father and has remained in power since 2003.The structural
formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new Constitution  on 12 November 1995. According
to the Article 23 of Constitution, the state symbols  of the Azerbaijan Republic are the flag, the coat of arms  and the national
anthem. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally
limited by the provisions of international agreements.

The government of Azerbaijan is based on the separation of powers  among the legislative, executive and judicial  branches. The
legislative power is held by the unicameral  National Assembly  and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous
Republic. Parliamentary elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The Yeni Azerbaijan Party, and
independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the 2010
Parliamentary election, the opposition parties, Musavat  and Azerbaijani Popular Front Party, failed to win a single seat.
European observers found numerous irregularities  in the run-up to the election and on election day.[121]

The executive power is held by the president, who is elected for a five-year term by direct elections, and the Prime Minister of
Azerbaijan. The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body, accountable to both the President and
the National Assembly. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the Prime Minister, his Deputies and Ministers. The
president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but he has the right to veto its decisions. To override the
presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the Constitutional Court, 
Supreme Court  and the Economic Court. The President nominates the judges in these courts.

The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was
established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial,
technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.

Although Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of
democracy, it remains classified as "not free" (on border with "partly free") by Freedom House.[122][123]  In recent years, large
numbers of Azerbaijani journalists, bloggers, lawyers, human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism
of President Aliyev and government authorities.[124]  A resolution adopted by the European Parliament in September 2015 described
Azerbaijan as "having suffered the greatest decline in democratic governance in all of Eurasia over the past ten years," noting as
well that its dialogue with the country on human rights has "not made any substantial progress."[125]

Azerbaijan has been harshly criticized for bribing foreign officials and diplomats for promoting its causes abroad and
legitimizing its elections at home, a practice which has been termed as 'caviar diplomacy'.[126][127][128][129]

FOREIGN RELATIONS
Main article: Foreign relations of AzerbaijanSee also: Azerbaijan and the European UnionVladimir Putin  in Azerbaijan in August
2013The short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries, sending
diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland.[130]  The process of international recognition of Azerbaijan's independence
from the collapsing Soviet Union lasted roughly one year. The most recent country to recognize Azerbaijan was Bahrain, on 6
November 1996.[131]  Full diplomatic relations, including mutual exchanges of missions, were first established with Turkey,
Pakistan, the United States, Iran[130]  and Israel.[132]  Azerbaijan has placed a particular emphasis on its "Special Relationship
" with Turkey.[133][134]

Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries so far and holds membership in 38 international organizations.[14]  It
holds observer status in the Non-Aligned Movement  and World Trade Organization  and is a correspondent at the International
Telecommunication Union.[14]  On 9 May 2006 Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly established Human Rights Council  by
the United Nations General Assembly. The term of office began on 19 June 2006.[16]

Ilham Aliyev  attends the Caspian Sea Summit in Astrakhan, Russia, 29 September 2014Foreign policy priorities of Azerbaijan
include, first of all, the restoration of its territorial integrity; elimination of the consequences of the loss of
Nagorno-Karabakh and seven other regions of Azerbaijan;[135][136]  integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structure;
contribution to international security; cooperation with international organizations; regional cooperation and bilateral
relations; strengthening of defense capability; promotion of security by domestic policy means; strengthening of democracy;
preservation of the ethnic and religious tolerance; scientific, educational, and cultural policy and preservation of moral values;
economic and social development; enhancing internal and border security; and migration, energy, and transportation security
policy.[135]

The Azerbaijani government, in late 2007, stated that the long-standing dispute over the Armenian-occupied territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh is almost certain to spark a new war if it remains unresolved.[135]  The Government is in the process of
increasing its military budget. Furthermore, an attack by the Azerbaijani military in 2016 on Armenian villages in
Nagorno-Karabakh has caused physical damage and raised controversy over the future of peaceful relations between Azerbaijan and
its neighbor, Armenia.[137]

Azerbaijan is an active member of international coalitions fighting international terrorism. The country is contributing to
peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Azerbaijan is an active member of NATO's Partnership for Peace  program. It
also maintains good relations with the European Union  and could potentially one day apply for membership.[135]

ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS
Main article: Administrative divisions of AzerbaijanAzerbaijan is divided into 10 economic regions; 66 rayons  (rayonlar, singular rayon) and 77 cities (şəhərlər, singular şəhər) of
which 12 are under the direct authority of the republic.[138]  Moreover, Azerbaijan includes the Autonomous Republic  (muxtar
respublika) of Nakhchivan.[96]  The President of Azerbaijan  appoints the governors of these units, while the government of
Nakhchivan is elected and approved by the parliament of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.

Azerbaijan is divided into 10 economic regionsNote: The cities under the direct authority of the republic in italics.

MILITARY
Main article: Azerbaijani Armed ForcesAzerbaijani Navy  fleet during the 2011 military parade in Baku.
Azerbaijani Special Forces during military parade.The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to Azerbaijan Democratic Republic  in 1918, when the National Army of the
newly formed Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was created on 26 June 1918.[139][140]  When Azerbaijan gained independence after the 
dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan were created according to the Law on the Armed
Forces of 9 October 1991.[141]  The original date of the establishment of the short-lived National Army is celebrated as Army Day
(26 June) in today's Azerbaijan.[142]  As of 2002, Azerbaijan had 95,000 active personnel in its armed forces. There are also
17,000 paramilitary troops.[143]  The armed forces have three branches: the Land Forces, the Air Forces  and the Navy.
Additionally the armed forces embrace several military sub-groups that can be involved in state defense when needed. These are the
 Internal Troops  of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Border Service, which includes the Coast Guard  as well.[96] 
The Azerbaijan National Guard  is a further paramilitary force. It operates as a semi-independent entity of the Special State
Protection Service, an agency subordinate to the President.[144]

Contingent from the Azerbaijani military during the Moscow Victory Day Parade, 9 May 2015Azerbaijan adheres to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe  and has signed all major international arms and weapons
treaties. Azerbaijan closely cooperates with NATO  in programs such as Partnership for Peace  and Individual Partnership Action
Plan. Azerbaijan has deployed 151 of its Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq and another 184 in Afghanistan.[145]

The defense budget of Azerbaijan for 2011 was set at US$3.1 billion.[146]  In addition to that, $1.36 billion was planned to be
used for the needs of the defense industry, which bring up the total military spending to billion.[146][147]  Azerbaijani
President Ilham Aliyev said on 26 June 2011 that the defence spending reached $3.3 billion that year.[148]

Azerbaijan's defense budget for 2013 is $3.7 billion.[149][150]

Azerbaijani defense industry manufactures small arms, artillery systems, tanks, armors and noctovision devices, aviation bombs,
pilotless vehicles, various military vehicles and military planes and helicopters.[151][152][153][154]

ECONOMY
Main article: Economy of AzerbaijanAfter gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank  and the Asian Development Bank.[155]  The banking system of
Azerbaijan consists of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, commercial banks  and non-banking credit organizations. The National (now
Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the
USSR. The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, and
to supervise all commercial banks. Two major commercial banks are UniBank  and the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan,
run by Dr. Jahangir Hajiyev.

Pushed up by spending and demand growth, the 2007 Q1  inflation rate reached 16.6%.[156]  Nominal incomes and monthly wages
climbed 29% and 25% respectively against this figure, but price increases in non-oil industry encouraged inflation.[156] 
Azerbaijan shows some signs of the so-called "Dutch disease" because of its fast-growing energy sector, which causes inflation and
makes non-energy exports more expensive.

In the early 2000s the chronically high inflation was brought under control. This led to the launch of a new currency, the new
Azerbaijani manat, on 1 January 2006, to cement the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy.[157][158]

In 2008, Azerbaijan was cited as one of the top 10 reformers by the World Bank's Doing Business Report.[159]

Azerbaijan led the world as the top reformer in 2007/08, with improvements on seven out of 10 indicators of regulatory reform.
Azerbaijan started operating a one-stop shop in January 2008 that halved the time, cost and number of procedures to start a
business. Business registrations increased by 40% in the first six months. Azerbaijan also eliminated the minimum loan cutoff of
$1,100, more than doubling the number of borrowers covered by the credit registry. Also, taxpayers can now file forms and pay
their taxes online. Azerbaijan's extensive reforms moved it far up the ranks, from 97 to 33 in the overall ease of doing business.

Azerbaijan is also ranked 57th in the Global Competitiveness Report  for 2010–2011, above other CIS countries.[160]  By 2012 the 
GDP  of Azerbaijan had increased 20-fold from to its 1995 level.[161]

ENERGY
Main article: Energy in AzerbaijanFurther information: Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan
A pumping unit  for the mechanical extraction of oil on the outskirts of Baku.Two-thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural
gas.[162]  The region of the Lesser Caucasus  accounts for most of the country's gold, silver, iron, copper, titanium, chromium, 
manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, complex ore  and antimony.[162]  In September 1994, a 30-year contract was signed between the 
State
Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic  (SOCAR) and 13 oil companies, among them Amoco, BP, ExxonMobil, Lukoil  and Statoil.[155]  As
Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields  untouched by the Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan is considered one of
the most important spots in the world for oil exploration  and development.[163]  Meanwhile, the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan  was
established as an extra-budgetary fund to ensure macroeconomic  stability, transparency in the management of oil revenue, and
safeguarding of resources for future generations.

Azeriqaz, a sub-company of SOCAR, intends to ensure full gasification of the country by 2021.[164]

AGRICULTURE
Main article: Agriculture in AzerbaijanAzerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region. About 54.9 percent of
Azerbaijan is agricultural land.[111]  At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of utilized agricultural area.[165] 
In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m³.[165]  Azerbaijan's agricultural scientific research institutes
are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and subtropical  crops, green vegetables, viticulture  and wine-making, cotton
growing and medicinal plants.[166]  In some areas it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, sugar beets, cotton[167]  and tobacco.
Livestock, dairy products, and wine and spirits  are also important farm products. The Caspian fishing industry  concentrates on
the dwindling stocks of sturgeon  and beluga. In 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine  had 54 ships.[168]

Some products previously imported from abroad have begun to be produced locally. Among them are Coca Cola by Coca Cola Bottlers
LTD, beer by Baki-Kastel, parquet by Nehir and oil pipes by EUPEC Pipe Coating Azerbaijan.[169]

TOURISM
Main article: Tourism in AzerbaijanShahdag Mountain Resort  is the country's largest winter resort.Tourism is an important part of
the economy of Azerbaijan. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s. However, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the
Nagorno-Karabakh War during the 1990s, damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.[170]

It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth
in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays.[171]  In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also becoming a popular destination
for religious, spa, and health care tourism.[172]  During winter, the Shahdag Mountain Resort  offers skiing with state of the art
facilities.

The government of Azerbaijan  has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination as a top priority. It is a
national strategy to make tourism a major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy.[173]  These
activities are regulated by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan.

TRANSPORTATION
Main articles: Transportation in Azerbaijan  and Rail transport in AzerbaijanThe convenient location of Azerbaijan on the
crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the Silk Road  and the south–north corridor, highlights the strategic
importance of transportation sector for the country's economy.[174]  The transport sector in the country includes roads, railways,
aviation, and maritime transport.

Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials. The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline  (BTC)
became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774 kilometers through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.
The BTC is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to
global markets.[175]  The South Caucasus Pipeline, also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became
operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the Shah Deniz gas field. Shah Deniz
is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year.[176]  Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the
EU-sponsored Silk Road Project.

In 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions.
In the same year, the country became a member of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.[177]  The highest priority being;
upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the
country, as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy.

In 2012, the construction of Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway  expected to provide transportation between Asia and Europe through
connecting the railways of China and Kazakhstan in the east with Turkey's Marmaray  to the European railway system in the west. 
Broad-gauge  railways in 2010 stretched for 2,918 km (1,813 mi) and electrified railways numbered 1,278 km (794 mi). By 2010,
there were 35 airports and one heliport.[96]

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Main articles: Communications in Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan National Aerospace Agency, and List of Azerbaijani inventions and
discoveriesShamakhi Astrophysical ObservatoryIn the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped to improve the situation in
Azerbaijan's science and technology sectors, and the government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and innovation. The
government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable with
those from oil production.[178]

Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing Internet sector, mostly uninfluenced by the global financial crisis; rapid growth is
forecast for at least five more years.[179]

The country has also been making progress in developing its telecoms sector. The Ministry of Communications & Information
Technologies (MCIT), as well as being an operator through its role in Aztelekom, is both a policy-maker and regulator. Public pay
phones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks.
Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration. As of 2009[update], there were 1,397,000 main telephone lines[180]  and 1,485,000
internet users.[181]  There are four GSM  providers: Azercell, Bakcell, Azerfon (Nar Mobile), Nakhtel  mobile network operators
and one CDMA.

In the 21st century a number of prominent Azerbaijani geodynamics  and geotectonics  scientists, inspired by the fundamental works
of Elchin Khalilov  and others, designed hundreds of earthquake prediction stations and earthquake-resistant buildings that now
constitute the bulk of The Republican Center of Seismic Service.[182][183][184]

The Azerbaijan National Aerospace Agency  launched its first satellite AzerSat 1  into orbit on 7 February 2013 from Guiana Space
Centre  in French Guiana at orbital positions 46° East.[185][186][187]  The satellite will cover Europe and significant part of
Asian countries and Africa and will have transmission for TV, radio broadcasting and the internet.[188]  The launch of its own
satellite on orbit is Azerbaijan's first action in realizing prospective projects to turn itself into a country with a space
industry.[189][190]

DEMOGRAPHICS
Main article: Demographics of AzerbaijanFurther information: Ethnic minorities in AzerbaijanEthnic composition (2009)[191]
Azerbaijani91.60%Lezgian2.02%Armenian1.35%Russian1.34%Talysh1.26%Other nations2.43%From the total population of 9,165,000 people
as of July 2011, nearly 52% was urban population, the remaining 48% was the rural population.[192]  51% of the total population
were female.[192]  The sex ratio  for total population in that year was therefore 0.97 males per female.[96]

The 2011 population growth-rate was 0.85%, compared to 1.09% worldwide.[96]  A significant factor restricting the population
growth is rather a high level of migration. In 2011 Azerbaijan saw migration of −1.14/1,000 people.[96]

The Azerbaijani diaspora  is found in 42 countries[193]  and in turn there are many centers for ethnic minorities inside
Azerbaijan, including the German cultural society "Karelhaus", Slavic  cultural center, Azerbaijani-Israeli community, Kurdish 
cultural center, International Talysh  Association, Lezgin  national center "Samur", Azerbaijani-Tatar  community, Crimean Tatars 
society, etc.[194]

The ethnic composition of the population according to the 2009 population census: 91.60% Azerbaijanis, 2.02% Lezgians, 1.35% 
Armenians  (almost all Armenians live in the break-away region of Nagorno-Karabakh), 1.34% Russians, 1.26% Talysh, 0.56% Avars,
0.43% Turks, 0.29% Tatars, 0.28% Tats, 0.24% Ukrainians, 0.14% Tsakhurs, 0.11% Georgians, 0.10% Jews, 0.07% Kurds, other 0.21%.

Iranian Azerbaijanis  are by far the largest minority in Iran. The number of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran furthermore far outnumber
those in neighboring Azerbaijan. The CIA World Factbook estimates Iranian Azerbaijanis as comprising at least 16% of Iran's
population.[195]

URBANIZATION
Main article: List of cities in AzerbaijanIn total, Azerbaijan has 77 cities, 64 smaller rayon-class cities, and one special legal status city. These are followed by 257
urban-type settlements and 4,620 villages.[196]

LANGUAGE
Main article: Languages of AzerbaijanThe official language is Azerbaijani, which is spoken by approximately 92% of the population as a mother tongue.[197]  It belongs
to the Turkic  language family. Russian and Armenian  are also spoken, and each are the mother tongue of around 1.5% of the
population respectively.[197]  Russian and English play significant roles as second or third languages of education and
communication.[citation needed]  There are a dozen other minority languages spoken natively in the country.[198]  Avar, Budukh,
[199]  Georgian, Juhuri,[199]  Khinalug,[199]  Kryts,[199]  Lezgian, Rutul,[199]  Talysh, Tat,[199]  Tsakhur,[199]  and Udi[199] 
are all spoken by small minorities. Some of these language communities are very small and their numbers are decreasing.[200] 
Armenian is almost exclusively spoken in the break-away Nagorno-Karabakh region.

of Azerbaijan has the second highest Shia population percentage in the world.[205]  Other faiths are practised by the country's
various ethnic groups. Under article 48 of its Constitution, Azerbaijan is a secular state  and ensures religious freedom. In a
2006–2008 Gallup  poll, only 21% of respondents from Azerbaijan stated that religion is an important part of their daily lives.
[206]

Of the nation's religious minorities, Christians who estimated 280,000 (3.1%)[207]  are mostly Russian  and Georgian  Orthodox 
and Armenian Apostolic  (almost all Armenians live in the break-away region of Nagorno-Karabakh).[96]  In 2003, there were 250 
Roman Catholics.[208]  Other Christian denominations as of 2002 include Lutherans, Baptists  and Molokans.[209]  There is also a
small Protestant  community.[210][211]  Azerbaijan also has an ancient Jewish  population with a 2,500-year history; Jewish
organizations estimate that 10,000–20,000 Jews remain in Azerbaijan.[212][213][214][215]  Azerbaijan also is home to members of
the Bahá'í, Hare Krishna  and Jehovah's Witnesses  communities, as well as adherents of the other religious communities.[209] 
Some religious communities have been unofficially restricted from religious freedom. A U.S. State Department  report on the matter
mentions detention of members of certain Muslim and Christian groups, and many groups have difficulty registering with the SCWRA.
[216]

EDUCATION
Main article: Education in Azerbaijan
Classroom in Dunya SchoolA relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in
scientific and technical subjects.[217]  In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their
very low starting point, despite two changes in the standard alphabet, from Perso-Arabic script  to Latin  in the 1920s and from
Roman to Cyrillic  in the 1930s. According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were
literate in 1970.[217]  According to the United Nations Development Program  Report 2009, the literacy rate in Azerbaijan is 99.5
percent.[218]

Since independence, one of the first laws that Azerbaijan's Parliament passed to disassociate itself from the Soviet Union was to
adopt a modified-Latin alphabet  to replace Cyrillic.[219]  Other than that the Azerbaijani system has undergone little structural
change. Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education (banned during the Soviet period) and
curriculum changes that have reemphasized the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content. In addition
to elementary schools, the education institutions include thousands of preschools, general secondary schools, and vocational
schools, including specialized secondary schools and technical schools. Education through the eighth grade is compulsory.

CULTURE
The Azerbaijani carpet  and Kalaghai, a UNESCO  Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage of Humanity.Main articles: Culture of
Azerbaijan  and Literature of AzerbaijanThe culture of Azerbaijan has developed as a result of many influences. Today, national
traditions are well preserved in the country despite Western influences, including globalized  on consumer culture. Some of the
main elements of the Azerbaijani culture are: music, literature, folk dances and art, cuisine, architecture, cinematography and 
Novruz Bayram. The latter is derived from the traditional celebration of the New Year in the ancient Iranian religion of 
Zoroastrianism. Novruz is a family holiday.[220]

Azerbaijan folk consists of Azerbaijanis, the representative part of society, as well as of nations and ethnic groups, compactly
living in various areas of the country. Azerbaijani national and traditional dresses are the Chokha  and Papakhi. There are radio
broadcasts in Russian, Armenian, Georgian, Kurdish, Lezgian  and Talysh  languages, which are financed from the state budget.[194] 
 Some local radio stations in Balakan  and Khachmaz  organize broadcasts in Avar  and Tat.[194]  In Baku several newspapers are
published in Russian, Kurdish (Dengi Kurd), Lezgian (Samur) and Talysh languages.[194]  Jewish society "Sokhnut" publishes the
newspaper Aziz.[194]

MUSIC AND FOLK DANCES
Main articles: Music of Azerbaijan  and Azerbaijani dancesUzeyir Hajibeyov  merged traditional Azerbaijani music  with Western
styles in the early 20th century.Music of Azerbaijan builds on folk traditions  that reach back nearly a thousand years.[221]  For centuries Azerbaijani music has
evolved under the badge of monody, producing rhythmically diverse melodies.[222]  Azerbaijani music has a branchy mode  system,
where chromatization  of major and minor  scales  is of great importance.[222]  Among national musical instruments there are 14 
string instruments, eight percussion instruments and six wind instruments.[223]  According to The Grove Dictionary of Music and
Musicians, "in terms of ethnicity, culture and religion the Azerbaijani are musically much closer to Iran than Turkey."[224]

The Azerbaijani Mugam, a UNESCO  Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage of Humanity, 16th-century miniature of Nizami Ganjavi's 
Khosrow and Shirin  tragic romance.Mugham, meykhana  and ashiq art  are among the many musical traditions of Azerbaijan. Mugham is usually a suite with poetry and
instrumental interludes. When performing mugham, the singers have to transform their emotions into singing and music. In contrast
to the mugham traditions of Central Asian countries, Azerbaijani mugham is more free-form and less rigid; it is often compared to
the improvised field of jazz.[225]  UNESCO  proclaimed the Azerbaijani mugham tradition a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible
Heritage of Humanity  on 7 November 2003. Meykhana is a kind of traditional Azerbaijani distinctive folk unaccompanied song,
usually performed by several people improvising on a particular subject.

Ashiq combines poetry, storytelling, dance and vocal and instrumental music into a traditional performance art that stands as a
symbol of Azerbaijani culture. It is a mystic troubadour or traveling bard who sings and plays the saz. This tradition has its
origin in the Shamanistic  beliefs of ancient Turkic peoples.[226]  Ashiqs' songs are semi-improvised around common bases.
Azerbaijan's ashiq art was included in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage  by the UNESCO on 30 September 2009.[227]

Since the mid-1960s, Western-influenced Azerbaijani pop music, in its various forms, that has been growing in popularity in
Azerbaijan, while genres as rock  and hip hop  of alternative music genres are encouraged. Azerbaijani pop and Azerbaijani folk
music  arose with the international popularity of performers like Alim Qasimov, Rashid Behbudov, Vagif Mustafazadeh, Muslim
Magomayev, Shovkat Alakbarova  and Rubaba Muradova.[228]  Azerbaijan is an enthusiastic participant in the Eurovision Song
Contest. Azerbaijan made its debut appearance at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The country's entry  gained the third place in
2009 and fifth the following year.[229]  Ell and Nikki  won the first place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011  with the song "
Running Scared", entitling Azerbaijan to host the contest in 2012, in Baku.[230][231]  They have never missed a Grand Final.

There are dozens of Azerbaijani folk dances. They are performed at formal celebrations and the dancers wear national clothes like
the Chokha, which is well-preserved within the national dances. Most dances have a very fast rhythm. The national dance shows the
characteristics of the Azerbaijani nation.

LITERATURE
Main article: Azerbaijani literature
Painting of Khurshidbanu Natavan, one of the most distinguished Azerbaijani poets. She was also the daughter of the last ruler of
the Karabakh Khanate.Among the medieval authors born within the territorial limits of modern Azerbaijani Republic was Persian poet
and philosopher Nizami, called Ganjavi after his place of birth, Ganja, who was the author of the Khamseh  ("The Quintuplet"),
composed of five romantic poems, including "The Treasure of Mysteries," "Khosrow and Shīrīn," and "Leyli and Mejnūn."[232]

The earliest known figure in Azerbaijani literature was Izzeddin Hasanoglu, who composed a divan  consisting of Persian and Turkic
 ghazals.[233][234]  In Persian ghazals he used his pen-name, while his Turkic ghazals were composed under his own name of
Hasanoghlu.[233]

Classical literature in Azerbaijani was formed in 14th century based on the various dialect Early Middle Ages dialects of Tabriz 
and Shirvan. Among the poets of this period were Gazi Burhanaddin, Haqiqi  (pen-name of Jahan-shah Qara Qoyunlu), and Habibi.[235] 
 The end of the 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of Imadaddin Nesimi,[236]  one of the greatest 
Turkic[237][238][239]  Hurufi  mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries[240]  and one of the most prominent early
divan masters in Turkic literary history,[240]  who also composed poetry in Persian[238][241]  and Arabic.[240]  The divan and
ghazal styles were further developed by poets Qasim al-Anvar, Fuzuli  and Khatai  (pen-name of Safavid  Shah Ismail I).

The Book of Dede Korkut  consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century,[242]  was not written earlier than the 15th
century.[243][244]  It is a collection of 12 stories reflecting the oral tradition of Oghuz nomads.[244]  The 16th-century poet,
Muhammed Fuzuli produced his timeless philosophical and lyrical Qazals  in Arabic, Persian, and Azerbaijani. Benefiting immensely
from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fizuli was destined to
become the leading literary figure of his society. His major works include The Divan of Ghazals  and The Qasidas. In the same
century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of Ashik  (Azerbaijani: Aşıq) poetic genre of bards.
During the same period, under the pen-name of Khatāī (Arabic: خطائی‎‎ for sinner) Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in
Azerbaijani,[245]  which were later published as his Divan. A unique literary style known as qoshma  (Azerbaijani: qoşma  for 
improvization) was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah Tahmasp I.

In the span of the 17th and 18th centuries, Fizuli's unique genres as well Ashik  poetry were taken up by prominent poets and
writers such as Qovsi of Tabriz, Shah Abbas Sani, Agha Mesih Shirvani, Nishat, Molla Vali Vidadi, Molla Panah Vagif, Amani, Zafar 
and others. Along with Turks, Turkmens  and Uzbeks, Azerbaijanis  also celebrate the Epic of Koroglu  (from Azerbaijani: kor oğlu 
for blind man's son), a legendary folk hero.[246]  Several documented versions of Koroglu epic remain at the Institute for
Manuscripts of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan.[234]

Modern literature in Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iran it is based on the Tabrizi one. The first
newspaper in Azerbaijani, Akinchi  was published in 1875. In the mid-19th century, it was taught in the schools of Baku, Ganja, 
Shaki, Tbilisi, and Yerevan. Since 1845, it has also been taught in the University of Saint Petersburg  in Russia.

FOLK ART
Main article: Azerbaijani folk art
Traditional Azerbaijani clothing and musical instruments.Azerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which
is decorative  and applied art. This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler,
engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery.
Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many
interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers
and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.

The Azerbaijani carpet  is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface,
whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was
proclaimed a Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage  by UNESCO.[247][248]

Handwork coppery in Lahic.Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The
archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working,
pottery, ceramics, and carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Archeological sites in Dashbulaq,
Hasansu, Zayamchai, and Tovuzchai uncovered from the BTC pipeline have revealed early Iron Age artifacts.[249]

Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. Scientific research of the
Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of Latif Kerimov, a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that
related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and
Tabriz.[250]

CUISINE
Main article: Azerbaijani cuisineDushbara, a traditional Azerbaijani meal.The traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of
vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes. Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley,
tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the
table. Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the 
Caspian
Sea, local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens. Saffron-rice plov  is the flagship
food in Azerbaijan and black tea  is the national beverage.[251]  Azerbaijanis often use traditional armudu  (pear-shaped) glass
as they have very strong tea culture.[252][253]  Popular traditional dishes include bozbash  (lamb soup that exists in several
regional varieties with the addition of different vegetables), qutab  (fried turnover with a filling of greens or minced meat) and
 dushbara  (sort of dumplings of dough filled with ground meat and flavor).

ARCHITECTURE
Main article: Architecture of AzerbaijanMomine Khatun Mausoleum  in Nakhchivan  built in the 12th centuryAzerbaijani architecture
typically combines elements of East  and West.[254]  Many ancient architectural treasures such as the Maiden Tower  and Palace of
the Shirvanshahs  in the Walled City of Baku  survive in modern Azerbaijan. Entries submitted on the UNESCO World Heritage 
tentative list include the Ateshgah of Baku, Momine Khatun Mausoleum, Hirkan National Park, Binegadi National Park, Lökbatan Mud
Volcano, Baku Stage Mountain, Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions, Shusha National Reserve, Ordubad National Reserve  and the 
Palace of Shaki Khans.[255][256]

Among other architectural treasures are Quadrangular Castle  in Mardakan, Parigala  in Yukhary Chardaglar, a number of bridges
spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created,
but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere. Among the most recent architectural monuments, the Baku subways  are
noted for their lavish decor.[257]

The task for modern Azerbaijani architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own
artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. Major projects such as Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center,
 Flame Towers, Baku Crystal Hall, Baku White City  and SOCAR Tower  have transformed the country's skyline and promotes its
contemporary identity.[258][259]

VISUAL ART
Main article: Visual arts of Azerbaijan
A miniature painting  of a battle scene on the walls of the Palace of Shaki Khans, 18th century, city of Shaki.Azerbaijani art
includes one of the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered as Gamigaya Petroglyphs  in the territory of Ordubad
Rayon  are dated back to the 1st to 4th centuries BC. About 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer, goats,
bulls, dogs, snakes, birds, fantastic beings and also people, carriages and various symbols had been found out on basalt rocks.
[260]  Norwegian ethnographer  and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl  was convinced that people from the area went to Scandinavia  in
about 100 AD and took their boat building skills with them, and transmuted them into the Viking boats in Northern Europe.[261]
[262]

Over the centuries, Azerbaijani art has gone through many stylistic changes. Azerbaijani painting is traditionally characterized
by a warmth of colour and light, as exemplified in the works of Azim Azimzade  and Bahruz Kangarli, and a preoccupation with
religious figures and cultural motifs.[263]  Azerbaijani painting enjoyed preeminence in Caucasus for hundreds of years, from the 
Romanesque  and Ottoman  periods, and through the Soviet  and Baroque  periods, the latter two of which saw fruition in
Azerbaijan. Other notable artists who fall within these periods include Sattar Bahlulzade, Togrul Narimanbekov, Tahir Salahov, 
Alakbar Rezaguliyev, Mirza Gadim Iravani, Mikayil Abdullayev  and Boyukagha Mirzazade.[264]

CINEMA
Scene from the Azerbaijani film In the Kingdom of Oil and Millions, 1916Main articles: Cinema of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani animation
, and Television in AzerbaijanThe film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first
countries involved in cinematography.[265]  Therefore, it's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in Baku  – at the
start of the 20th century, this bay town on the Caspian  was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just
like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work.[266]  In 1919, during the Azerbaijan Democratic
Republic, a documentary The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence  was filmed on Azerbaijan's independence
day, 28 May, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku.[267]  After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman
Narimanov, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema. This also
influenced the creation of Azerbaijani animation.[267]

In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was
held in Baku. In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming 2 August to be the
professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those
faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choice of content and
sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.[265]

MEDIA AND MEDIA FREEDOM
Main articles: Media of Azerbaijan  and Media freedom in AzerbaijanThere are three state-owned television channels: AzTV, Idman TV  and Medeniyyet TV. One public channel and 6 private channels: 
İctimai Television, ANS TV, Space TV, Lider TV, Azad Azerbaijan TV, Xazar TV  and Region TV.

Print and broadcast media in Azerbaijan are almost wholly under control of the ruling Aliyev family, eventually through friendly
intermediaries.[268]  Ownership opacity is backed by law. Azerbaijan hosts 9 national TV stations (of which a public service
broadcaster and 3 more state-run channels), over 12 regional TV stations, 25 radio channels, over 30 daily newspapers. Opposition
media manages to work on the perpetual brink of survival.[269]

HUMAN RIGHTS IN AZERBAIJAN
Main article: Human rights in AzerbaijanThe Constitution of Azerbaijan  claims to guarantee freedom of speech, but this is denied in practice. After several years of
decline in press and media freedom, in 2014 the media environment in Azerbaijan deteriorated fast under a governmental campaign to
silence any opposition and criticism, even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe 
(May–November 2014). Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm.[270]  All foreign
broadcasts are banned in the country.[269]

According to the 2013 Freedom House  Freedom of the Press report, Azerbaijan's press freedom status is "not free," and Azerbaijan
ranks 177th out of 196 countries.[271]

BBC, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty  and Voice of America  are banned in Azerbaijan.[272]

During the last few years, three journalists were killed and several prosecuted in trials described as unfair by international
human rights organizations. Azerbaijan has the biggest number of journalists imprisoned in Europe and Central Asia in 2015,
according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and is the 5th most censored country in the world, ahead of Iran and China.
[273]

A report by an Amnesty International  researcher in October 2015 points to '...the severe deterioration of human rights in
Azerbaijan over the past few years. Sadly Azerbaijan has been allowed to get away with unprecedented levels of repression and in
the process almost wipe out its civil society'.[274]  Amnesty's 2015/16 annual report[275]  on the country stated ' ...
persecution of political dissent continued. Human rights organizations remained unable to resume their work. At least 18 prisoners
of conscience remained in detention at the end of the year. Reprisals against independent journalists and activists persisted both
in the country and abroad, while their family members also faced harassment and arrests. International human rights monitors were
barred and expelled from the country. Reports of torture and other ill-treatment persisted.'

SPORTS
Main article: Sport in AzerbaijanShakhriyar Mamedyarov  was the 2013 World Rapid Chess  and two-time European Team Chess

to advance to the group stage of a European competition, beating APOEL  of Cyprus 4-2 on aggregate in the play-off round of the 
2012-13 UEFA Europa League.[279][280]  In 2014, Qarabağ became the second Azerbaijani club advancing to the group stage of UEFA
Europa League. Futsal  is another popular sport in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijan national futsal team  reached fourth place in the 
2010 UEFA Futsal Championship, while domestic club Araz Naxçivan  clinched bronze medals at the 2009–10 UEFA Futsal Cup  and 
2013–14 UEFA Futsal Cup.[281]  Azerbaijan is the main sponsor of Spanish football club Atlético de Madrid, a partnership that the
club describes should 'promote the image of Azerbaijan in the world'.[282]

Azerbaijan is one of the traditional powerhouses of world chess,[283]  having hosted many international chess tournaments and
competitions and became European Team Chess Championship  winners in 2009 and 2013.[284][285][286]  Notable chess players from
country's chess schools that made a great impact on the game in world, includes Teimour Radjabov, Shahriyar Mammadyarov, Vladimir
Makogonov, Vugar Gashimov  and former World Chess Champion  Garry Kasparov. As of 2014[update], country's home of Shamkir Chess  a
category 22 event and one of the highest rated tournaments of all time.[287]  Backgammon  also plays a major role in Azerbaijani
culture.[288]  The game is very popular in Azerbaijan and is widely played among the local public.[289]  There are also different
variations of backgammon developed and analyzed by Azerbaijani experts.[290]

Baku National Stadium  was used for the first European Games  in June 2015.Azerbaijan is one of the leading volleyball countries
in the world and its Azerbaijan Women's Volleyball Super League  is one of strongest women leagues in world. Its women's national
team came fourth at the 2005 European Championship.[291]  Over the last years, clubs like Rabita Baku  and Azerrail Baku  achieved
great success at European cups.[292]  Azerbaijani volleyball players include likes of Valeriya Korotenko, Oksana Parkhomenko, 
Inessa Korkmaz, Natalya Mammadova  and Alla Hasanova.

      encompass all regions of the republic of Azerbaijan, name Arran  can be chosen. But the term Azerbaijan was chosen because
      when the Azerbaijan republic was created, it was assumed that this and the Persian Azerbaijan  will be one entity, because
      the population of both has a big similarity. On this basis, the word Azerbaijan was chosen. Of course right now when the
      word Azerbaijan is used, it has two meanings as Persian Azerbaijan and as a republic, its confusing and a question rises as
      to which Azerbaijan is talked about.  |access-date=  requires |url=  (help)

      Arran or the western Caucasian Albania  roughly corresponds to the modern territory of the republic of Azerbaijan. In the 
      Soviet  era, in a breathtaking manipulation, historical Azerbaijan  (northwestern Iran) was reinterpreted as "South
      Azerbaijan" in order for the Soviets to lay territorial claim on historical Azerbaijan proper which is located in modern-day
      northwestern Iran.  |access-date=  requires |url=  (help)

      395–417. excerpt: The Book of Dede Korkut is an early record of oral Turkic folktales in Anatolia, and as such, one of the
      mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts
      copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a
      cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan.
      According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and
      their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to
      the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks
      in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written
      versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the
      Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves
      "Turcoman" rather than "Oghuz," had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in
      Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.
 243. ^  Cemal Kafadar(1995), "in Between Two Worlds: Construction of the Ottoman states", University of California Press, 1995.
      Excerpt: "It was not earlier than the fifteenth century. Based on the fact that the author is buttering up both the
      Akkoyunlu and Ottoman rulers, it has been suggested that the composition belongs to someone living in the undefined border
      region lands between the two states during the reign of Uzun Hassan (1466–78). G. Lewis on the hand dates the composition
      "fairly early in the 15th century at least."

southeastern range of the Lesser Caucasus  mountains. The region is mostly mountainous and forested.

Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed territory, internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan,[3]  but most of the region is governed
by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, a de facto  independent state with Armenian ethnic majority established on the basis of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast  of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Azerbaijan has not exercised political authority
over the region since the advent of the Karabakh movement  in 1988. Since the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War  in 1994,
representatives of the governments of Armenia  and Azerbaijan have been holding peace talks mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group  on
the region's disputed status.

The region is usually equated with the administrative borders of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast  comprising an area
of 4,400 square kilometres (1,700 sq mi). The historical area of the region, however, encompasses approximately 8,223 square
kilometres (3,175 sq mi).[4][5]



NAME
The snow-covered Lesser Caucasus seen south of the Greater Caucasus. About 1800 the Karabagh Khanate was based in the southeast
corner of the Lesser Caucasus. It extended east into the lowlands, hence the name Nagorno-  or "Highland-" Karabagh for the
western part.The prefix Nagorno-  derives from the Russian attributive adjective  nagorny  (нагорный), which means "highland". The Azerbaijani 
names of the region include the similar adjectives "dağlıq" (mountainous) or "yuxarı" (upper). Such words are not used in the 
Armenian  name, but they have appeared in the official name of the region during the Soviet  era as Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous
Oblast. Other languages apply their own wording for mountainous, upper, or highland; for example, the official name used by the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  in French is Haut-Karabakh, meaning "Upper Karabakh".[citation needed]

The name Karabakh  comprises two words, "kara" (meaning "black" in Turkic) and "bagh" (or "bakh", meaning "garden" in Persian).
Thus Karabakh  literally means "black garden".[6][7]  The name first appears in Georgian  and Persian sources of the 13th and 14th
centuries.[7]  Karabagh, an acceptable alternate spelling of Karabakh, denotes a kind of patterned rug  originally produced in the
area.[8]

According to an alternative theory proposed by Bagrat Ulubabyan, the name Karabakh  has a Turkic–Armenian origin, meaning "Greater
Baghk" (Armenian: Մեծ Բաղք), a reference to Ktish-Baghk (later: Dizak), one of the principalities of Artsakh under the rule of the
 Aranshahik  dynasty, which held the throne of the Kingdom of Syunik in the 11th–13th centuries and called itself the "Kingdom of
Baghk".[9]

The names for the region in the various local languages all translate to "mountainous Karabakh", or "mountainous black garden":

 * Armenian: Լեռնային Ղարաբաղ, transliterated  Leṙnayin Ġarabaġ  (IPA: /lɛrnɑˈjin ʁɑɾɑˈbɑʁ/)
 * Azerbaijani: Dağlıq Qarabağ, Дағлыг Гарабағ  (mountainous Karabakh; IPA: /dɑɣˈlɯɣ ɡɑˈɾɑbɑɣ/) or Yuxarı Qarabağ, Јухары Гарабағ 
   (upper Karabakh; IPA: /juxɑˈɾɯ ɡɑˈɾɑbɑɣ/)
 * Russian: Нагорный Карабах, transliterated  Nagornyy Karabakh  or Nagornyi Karabah  (IPA: /nɐˈɡornɨj kərɐˈbax/)

The Armenians  living in the area often refer to Nagorno-Karabakh as Artsakh  (Armenian: Արցախ), using the name of the 10th
province of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia. Urartian  inscriptions (9th–7th centuries BC) use the name Urtekhini  for the region.
[10]  Ancient Greek  sources called the area Orkhistene.[11]

HISTORY
ANTIQUITY AND EARLY MIDDLE AGES
Main article: History of Nagorno-Karabakh
The Amaras Monastery, founded in the 4th century by St. Gregory the Illuminator. In the 5th century, Mesrop Mashtots, inventor of
the Armenian alphabet, established at Amaras the first school to use his script.[12][13]The monastery at Gandzasar  was
commissioned by the House of Khachen  and completed in 1238Nagorno-Karabakh falls within the lands occupied by peoples known to
modern archaeologists as the Kura-Araxes culture, who lived between the two rivers Kura  and Araxes.

The ancient population of the region consisted of various autochthonous  local and migrant tribes who were mostly
non-Indo-Europeans.[14]  According to the prevailing western theory, these natives intermarried with Armenians who came to the
region after its inclusion into Armenia in the 2nd or, possibly earlier, in 4th century BC.[15]  Other scholars suggest that the
Armenians settled in the region as early as in the 7th century BC.[16]

In around 180 BC, Artsakh became one of the 15 provinces of the Armenian Kingdom  and remained so until the 4th century.[17] 
While formally having the status of a province (nahang), Artsakh possibly formed a principality  on its own — like Armenia's
province of Syunik. Other theories suggest that Artsakh was a royal land, belonging to the King of Armenia directly.[18]  Tigran
the Great, King of Armenia, (ruled from 95–55 BC), founded in Artsakh one of four cities named "Tigranakert" after himself.[19] 
The ruins of the ancient Tigranakert, located 30 miles (48 km) north-east of Stepanakert, are being studied by a group of
international scholars.

In 387 AD, after the partition of Armenia between Byzantium  and Sassanid Persia, two Armenian provinces Artsakh and Utik  became
part of the Sassanid satrapy of Caucasian Albania, which, in turn, came under strong Armenian religious and cultural influence.
[20][21]  At the time the population of Artsakh and Utik consisted of Armenians and several Armenized tribes.[14]

Armenian culture and civilization flourished in the early medieval Nagorno-Karabakh. In the 5th century, the first-ever Armenian
school was opened on the territory of modern Nagorno-Karabakh—at the Amaras Monastery—by the efforts of St. Mesrop Mashtots, the
inventor of the Armenian alphabet.[22]  St. Mesrop was very active in preaching Gospel in Artsakh and Utik. Overall, Mesrop
Mashtots made three trips to Artsakh and Utik, ultimately reaching pagan territories at the foothills of the Greater Caucasus.[23] 
 The 7th-century Armenian linguist and grammarian Stephanos Syunetsi stated in his work that Armenians of Artsakh had their own
dialect, and encouraged his readers to learn it.[24]  In the same 7th century, Armenian[25]  poet Davtak Kertogh  writes his Elegy
on the Death of Grand Prince Juansher, where each passage begins with a letter of Armenian script in alphabetical order.[26][27] 
The only comprehensive history of Caucasian Albania was written in Armenian, by the historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi.[27]

HIGH MIDDLE AGES
Main article: Principality of KhachenAround the mid 7th century, the region was conquered by the invading Muslim Arabs through the
 Muslim conquest of Persia. Subsequently, it was ruled by local governors endorsed by the Caliphate. In 821 the Armenian[28] 
prince Sahl Smbatian  revolted in Artsakh and established the House of Khachen, which ruled Artsakh as a principality  until the
early 19th century.[29]  The name "Khachen" originated from Armenian word "khach," which means "cross".[30]  By 1000 the House of
Khachen proclaimed the Kingdom of Artsakh  with John Senecherib  as its first ruler.[31]  Initially Dizak, in southern Artsakh,
formed also a kingdom ruled by the ancient House of Aranshahik, descended of the earliest Kings of Caucasian Albania. In 1261,
after the daughter of the last king of Dizak married the king of Artsakh, Armenian[32]  prince Hasan Jalal Dola, the two states
merged into one[29]  Armenian[33]  Principality of Khachen. Subsequently, Artsakh continued to exist as a de facto independent
principality.

LATE MIDDLE AGES
Main article: Melikdoms of Karabakh
The Askeran Fortress, built by the Karabakh Khanate  ruler Panah Ali Khan  in the 18th century
The semi-independent Five Principalities  (Armenian: Խամսայի Մելիքություններ) of Karabakh (Gyulistan, Jraberd, Khachen, Varanda,
and Dizak), widely considered to be the last relic of Armenian statehood (15th-19th century).[34][35].

In the 15th century, the territory of Karabakh was part of the states ruled subsequently by the Kara Koyunlu  and Ak Koyunlu  
Turkic  tribal confederations. The Turkoman  lord Jahan Shah  (1437–67) assigned the governorship of upper Karabakh to local
Armenian princes, allowing a native Armenian leadership to emerge consisting of five noble families led by princes who held the
titles of meliks.[29]  These dynasties represented the branches of the earlier House of Khachen and were the descendants of the
medieval kings of Artsakh. Their lands were often referred to as the Country of Khamsa  (five  in Arabic). The Russian Empire 
recognized the sovereign  status of the five princes in their domains by a charter of the Emperor Paul I  dated 2 June 1799.[36]

The Armenian meliks were granted supreme command over neighboring Armenian principalities and Muslim khans in the Caucasus by the
Iranian king Nader Shah, in return for the meliks' victories over the invading Ottoman  Turks  in the 1720s.[37]  These five
principalities [38][39]  in Karabakh were ruled by Armenian families who had received the title Melik (prince) and were the
following:

 * Principality of Gulistan  - under the leadership of the Melik-Beglarian family
 * Principality of Jraberd  - under the leadership of the Melik-Israelian family
 * Principality of Khachen  - under the leadership of the Hasan-Jalalian  family
 * Principality of Varanda  - under the leadership of the Melik-Shahnazarian family
 * Principality of Dizak  - under the leadership of the Melik-Avanian family

The Armenian meliks maintained full control over the region until the mid-18th century.[40][citation needed]  In the early 18th
century, Iran's Nader Shah  took Karabakh out of control of the Ganja khans in punishment for their support of the Safavids, and
placed it under his own control[41][42]  In the mid-18th century, as internal conflicts between the meliks led to their weakening,

[40]  the Karabakh Khanate was formed.

and general Pavel Tsitsianov  on behalf of Tsar Alexander I  in 1805, according to which the Russian monarch recognized Ibrahim
Khalil Khan and his descendants as the sole hereditary rulers of the region.[43][44][45]  However, its new status was only
confirmed following the outcome of the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813), when through the loss in the war, Persia formally ceded
Karabakh to the Russian Empire per the Treaty of Gulistan  (1813),[46][47][48][49]  before the rest of Transcaucasia  was
incorporated into the Empire in 1828 by the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which came as an outcome of the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828).

In 1822, 9 years after passing from Iranian to Russian control, the Karabakh Khanate was dissolved, and the area became part of
the Elisabethpol Governorate  within the Russian Empire. After the transfer of the Karabakh Khanate to Russia, many Muslim
families immigrated to Persia, while many Armenians were induced by the Russian government to emigrate from Persia to Karabakh.

SOVIET ERA
Main article: Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast
Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast in the Soviet era.
Ethnic make-up of Nagorno-Karabakh in the late Soviet era.The present-day conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh has its roots in the
decisions made by Joseph Stalin  and the Caucasian Bureau (Kavburo) during the Sovietization  of Transcaucasia. Stalin was the
acting Commissar of Nationalities  for the Soviet Union during the early 1920s, the branch of the government under which the
Kavburo was created. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Karabakh became part of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative
Republic, but this soon dissolved into separate Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian  states. Over the next two years (1918–1920),
there were a series of short wars  between Armenia and Azerbaijan over several regions, including Karabakh. In July 1918, the
First Armenian Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh declared the region self-governing and created a National Council and government.[51] 
Later, Ottoman troops entered Karabakh, meeting armed resistance by Armenians.

After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire  in World War I, British troops occupied Karabakh.[40]  The British command provisionally
affirmed Khosrov bey Sultanov  (appointed by the Azerbaijani government) as the governor-general of Karabakh and Zangezur, pending
final decision by the Paris Peace Conference.[52]  The decision was opposed by Karabakh Armenians. In February 1920, the Karabakh
National Council preliminarily agreed to Azerbaijani jurisdiction, while Armenians elsewhere in Karabakh continued guerrilla
fighting, never accepting the agreement.[40][51]  The agreement itself was soon annulled by the Ninth Karabagh Assembly, which
declared union with Armenia in April.[40][51][53]

In April 1920, while the Azerbaijani army was locked in Karabakh fighting local Armenian forces, Azerbaijan was taken over by 
Bolsheviks.[40]  On 10 August 1920, Armenia signed a preliminary agreement with the Bolsheviks, agreeing to a temporary Bolshevik
occupation of these areas until final settlement would be reached.[54]  In 1921, Armenia and Georgia were also taken over by the 
Bolsheviks  who, in order to attract public support, promised they would allot Karabakh to Armenia, along with Nakhchivan  and
Zangezur (the strip of land separating Nakhchivan from Karabakh). However, the Soviet Union also had far-reaching plans concerning
 Turkey, hoping that it would, with a little help from them, develop along Communist  lines. Needing to placate Turkey, the Soviet
Union agreed to a division under which Zangezur would fall under the control of Armenia, while Karabakh and Nakhchivan would be
under the control of Azerbaijan. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would likely have left Karabakh under Armenian control.[55] 
As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast  was established within the Azerbaijan SSR on 7 July 1923.

With the Soviet Union firmly in control of the region, the conflict over the region died down for several decades. With the
beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the question of Nagorno-Karabakh re-emerged.
Accusing the Azerbaijani SSR government of conducting forced Azerification of the region, the majority Armenian population, with
ideological and material support from the Armenian SSR, started a movement to have the autonomous oblast transferred to the
Armenian SSR. The oblast's borders were drawn to include Armenian villages and to exclude as much as possible Azerbaijani
villages. The resulting district ensured an Armenian majority.[56]  In August 1987, Karabakh Armenians sent a petition for union
with Armenia with tens of thousands of signatures to Moscow.[57]

WAR AND SECESSION
Main article: Nagorno-Karabakh War
A restored Armenian T-72, knocked out of commission while attacking Azeri positions in Askeran District, serves as a war memorial
on the outskirts of Stepanakert.On 13 February 1988, Karabakh Armenians began demonstrating in their capital, Stepanakert, in favour of unification with the
Armenian republic. Six days later they were joined by mass marches in Yerevan. On 20 February, the Soviet of People's Deputies in
Karabakh voted 110 to 17 to request the transfer of the region to Armenia. This unprecedented action by a regional soviet brought
out tens of thousands of demonstrations both in Stepanakert and Yerevan, but Moscow rejected the Armenians' demands. On 22
February 1988, the first direct confrontation of the conflict occurred as a large group of Azeris marched from Agdam  against the
Armenian populated town of Askeran, "wreaking destruction en route". The confrontation between the Azeris and the police near
Askeran degenerated into the Askeran clash, which left two Azeris dead, one of them reportedly killed by an Azeri police officer,
as well as 50 Armenian villagers, and an unknown number of Azeris and police injured.[58][59]  Large numbers of refugees left
Armenia and Azerbaijan as violence began against the minority populations of the respective countries.[60]

On 29 November 1989, direct rule in Nagorno-Karabakh was ended and the region was returned to Azerbaijani administration.[61]  The
Soviet policy backfired, however, when a joint session of the Armenian Supreme Soviet  and the National Council, the legislative
body of Nagorno-Karabakh, proclaimed the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia.[citation needed]  In 1989, Nagorno-Karabakh
had a population of 192,000.[62]  The population at that time was 76 percent Armenian and 23 percent Azerbaijanis, with Russian 
and Kurdish  minorities.[62]  On 26 November 1991 Azerbaijan abolished the status of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast,
rearranging the administrative division  and bringing the territory under direct control of Azerbaijan.[63]

On 10 December 1991, in a referendum boycotted by local Azerbaijanis,[59]  Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh approved the creation of
an independent state. A Soviet proposal for enhanced autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan satisfied neither side, and 
a
full-scale war  subsequently erupted between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, with the latter receiving support from Armenia.[64]
[65][66][67]  According to Armenia's former president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, the Karabakh leadership approach was maximalist and
"they thought they could get more."[68][69][70]

The struggle over Nagorno-Karabakh escalated after both Armenia and Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union in
1991. In the post-Soviet power vacuum, military action between Azerbaijan and Armenia was heavily influenced by the Russian
military. Furthermore, both the Armenian and Azerbaijani military employed a large number of mercenaries from Ukraine  and Russia.

[71]  As many as one thousand Afghan  mujahideen  participated in the fighting on Azerbaijan's side.[59]  There were also fighters
from Chechnya  fighting on the side of Azerbaijan, as well heavy artillery and tanks provided to Armenia by Russia.[59]  Many
survivors from the Azerbaijani side found shelter in 12 emergency camps set up in other parts of Azerbaijan to cope with the
growing number of internally displaced people due to the Nagorno-Karabakh war.[72]

By the end of 1993, the conflict had caused thousands of casualties and created hundreds of thousands of refugees on both sides.[
citation needed]  By May 1994, the Armenians were in control of 14% of the territory of Azerbaijan. At that stage, for the first
time during the conflict, the Azerbaijani government recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as a third party in the war, and started direct
negotiations with the Karabakh authorities.[40]  As a result, a cease-fire was reached on 12 May 1994 through Russian negotiation.

November 2008Despite the ceasefire, fatalities due to armed conflicts between Armenian and Azerbaijani soldiers continued.[73]  On 25 January
2005, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe  (PACE) adopted PACE Resolution 1416, which condemned alleged ethnic
cleansing against Azerbaijanis.[74][75]  On 15–17 May 2007 the 34th session of the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the 
Organization of Islamic Conference  adopted resolution № 7/34-P, considering the occupation of Azerbaijani territory as the
aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan and recognizing the actions against Azerbaijani civilians as a crime against humanity,
and condemning the destruction of archaeological, cultural and religious monuments in the occupied territories.[76]  The 11th
session of the summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  held on 13–14 March 2008 in Dakar  adopted resolution No.
10/11-P (IS). In the resolution, OIC member states condemned the occupation of Azerbaijani lands by Armenian forces and Armenian
aggression against Azerbaijan, alleged ethnic cleansing against the Azeri population, and charged Armenia with the "destruction of
cultural monuments in the occupied Azerbaijani territories".[77]  On 14 March of the same year the UN General Assembly  adopted 
Resolution № 62/243  which "demands the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied
territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan".[78]  On 18–20 May 2010, the 37th session of the Council of Ministers of Foreign
Affairs of the Organization of Islamic Conference in Dushanbe  adopted another resolution condemning the aggression of Armenia
against Azerbaijan, recognizing the actions against Azerbaijani civilians as a crime against humanity and condemning the
destruction of archaeological, cultural, and religious monuments in occupied territories.[79]  On 20 May of the same year, the 
European Parliament  in Strasbourg  adopted the resolution on "The need for an EU Strategy for the South Caucasus" on the basis of
the report by Evgeni Kirilov, the Bulgarian member of the Parliament.[80][81]  The resolution states in particular that "the
occupied Azerbaijani regions around Nagorno-Karabakh must be cleared as soon as possible".[82]

Several[quantify]  world leaders  have met with the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan over the years, but efforts to maintain
the ceasefire have failed.[83]

2 April 2016 saw reports of renewed military activities between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces.[84]  The Armenian Defense
Ministry  alleged that Azerbaijan launched an offensive to seize territory in the region. At least 30 soldiers were killed during
the fighting and a Mil Mi-24  helicopter and tank were also destroyed, with 12 of the fallen soldiers belonging to the Azerbaijani
forces and the other 18 belonging to the Armenian forces, as well as an additional 35 Armenian soldiers reportedly wounded.[85]

GEOGRAPHY
The Sarsang Reservoir
A view of the forested mountains of Nagorno-KarabakhNagorno-Karabakh has a total area of 4,400 square kilometres (1,699 sq mi).[87]  Approximately half of Nagorno-Karabakh terrain is
over 950 metres (3,120 ft) above sea level.[88]  The borders of Nagorno-Karabakh resemble a kidney bean with the indentation on
the east side. It has tall mountain ridges along the northern edge and along the west and a mountainous south. The part near the
indentation of the kidney bean itself is a relatively flat valley, with the two edges of the bean, the provinces of Martakert  and
 Martuni, having flat lands as well. Other flatter valleys exist around the Sarsang reservoir, Hadrut, and the south. The entire
region lies, on average, 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) above sea level.[88]  Notable peaks include the border mountain Murovdag  and the
 Great Kirs  mountain chain in the junction of Shusha Rayon  and Hadrut. The territory of modern Nagorno-Karabakh forms a portion
of the historic region of Karabakh, which lies between the rivers Kura  and Araxes, and the modern Armenia-Azerbaijan border.
Nagorno-Karabakh in its modern borders is part of the larger region of Upper Karabakh.

Nagorno-Karabakh’s environment vary from steppe  on the Kura lowland through dense forests of oak, hornbeam, and beech  on the
lower mountain slopes to birchwood  and alpine meadows  higher up. The region possesses numerous mineral springs  and deposits of 
zinc, coal, lead, gold, marble, and limestone.[89]  The major cities of the region are Stepanakert, which serves as the capital of
the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Shusha, which lies partially in ruins. Vineyards, orchards, and mulberry groves for silkworms
are developed in the valleys.[90]

DEMOGRAPHICS
Main article: Demographics of Nagorno-Karabakh18TH CENTURY
Population statistics for Nagorno-Karabakh are available from the 18th century. Archimandrite Minas Tigranian, after completing
his secret mission to Persian Armenia ordered by the Russian Tsar Peter the Great  stated in a report dated 14 March 1717 that the
patriarch of the Gandzasar Monastery, in Nagorno-Karabakh, had under his authority 900 Armenian villages.[91]

In his letter of 1769 to Russia’s Count P. Panin, the Georgian King Erekle II, in his description of Nagorno-Karabakh, suggests:
"Seven families rule the region of Khamsa. Its population is totally Armenian."[92][93]

When discussing Karabakh and Shusha  in the 18th century, the Russian diplomat and historian Semyon M. Bronevskiy (Russian: Семён
Михайлович Броневский) indicated in his Historical Notes  that Karabakh, which he said "is located in Greater Armenia" had as many
as 30,000–40,000 armed Armenian men in 1796.[94]

19TH CENTURY
A survey prepared by the Russian imperial authorities in 1823, several years before the 1828 Armenian migration from Persia to the
newly established Armenian Province, shows that all Armenians of Karabakh compactly resided in its highland portion, i.e. on the
territory of the five traditional Armenian principalities in Nagorno-Karabakh, and constituted an absolute demographic majority on
those lands.[95]  The survey's more than 260 pages recorded that the district of Khachen had 12 Armenian villages and no Tatar
(Muslim) villages; Jalapert (Jraberd) had eight Armenian villages and no Tatar villages; Dizak had 14 Armenian villages and one
Tatar village; Gulistan had 12 Armenian and five Tatar villages; and Varanda had 23 Armenian villages and one Tatar village.[96]
[97]

20TH CENTURY
During the Soviet times, the leaders of the Azerbaijan SSR tried to change demographic balance in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous
Region (NKAO) by increasing the number of Azerbaijani residents through opening a university with Azerbaijani, Russian and
Armenian sectors and a shoe factory, sending Azerbaijanis from other parts of Azerbaijani SSR to the NKAO. "By doing this", Aliyev
said in an interview in 2002, "I tried to increase the number of Azeris and to reduce the number of Armenians".[98][99]

Nearing the collapse of the Soviet Union  in 1989, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast had a population of 145,593 Armenians
(76.4 percent), 42,871 Azerbaijanis (22.4 percent),[71]  and several thousand Kurds, Russians, Greeks  and Assyrians. Most of the
Azerbaijani and Kurdish populations fled the region during the heaviest years of fighting in the war from 1992 to 1993. The main
language spoken in Nagorno-Karabakh is Armenian; however, Karabakh Armenians speak a dialect of Armenian  that is considerably
different from the Yerevan dialect spoken by most in Armenia, but is similar to the dialects of Southern Syunik and even Eastern 
Tavush, areas that were historically closely linked to Artsakh.[citation needed]

Ethnic groups of the region in 1995. (See entire map)21ST CENTURY
In 2001, the NKR's reported population was 95 percent Armenian, with the remaining total including Assyrians, Greeks, and Kurds.
[100]  In March 2007, the local government announced that its population had grown to 138,000. The annual birth rate was recorded
at 2,200–2,300 per year, an increase from nearly 1,500 in 1999. Until 2000, the country's net migration was at a negative.[101] 
For the first half of 2007, 1,010 births and 659 deaths were reported, with a net emigration of 27.[102]

In 2011, officials from YAP  submitted a letter to OSCE which included the statement, "The OSCE fact-finding mission report
released last year also found that some 15,000 Armenians have been illegally settled on Azerbaijan's occupied territories."
However, the OSCE report, released in March 2011, estimates the population of territories controlled by ethnic Armenians "adjacent
to the breakaway Azerbaijani region of Nagorno-Karabakh" to be 14,000, and states "there has been no significant growth in the
population since 2005."[103]

Most of the Armenian population is Christian  and belongs to the Armenian Apostolic Church. Certain Orthodox Christian  and 
Evangelical Christian  denominations also exist; other religions include Judaism.[100]

39.90139; 46.78694﻿ (Stepanakert Air Base)During rule of the Soviet Union, the Yevlax-Ağdam-Xankəndi(Stepanakert) line connected the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region with
the main part of Azerbaijan. After the Nagorno-Karabakh war and the abandonment of Ağdam, the line’s service was cut back to
service only between Yevlax and Kətəlparaq, without any present section at the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The former railway line
between Kətəlparaq and Stepanakert has been almost completely destroyed.

The (Tbilisi-Gyumri-)Yerevan-Naxçıvan-Horadiz-Şirvan(-Bakı) main railway was also dismantled from the NKR between Ordubad  and 
Horadiz, and a by-line from Mincivan  to the Armenian city of Kapan. Currently, the Azerbaijani trains only travel to Horadiz. The
Ordubad-Horadiz section has been demolished, leaving the NKR with no intact, active railway line in their territory. The railway
at the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic still operates, but it is separated from the main Azerbaijani lines, and only has connection
to Iran.

Declaration of Independence  in 1776Chile, one of several Spanish  colonies in South America, issued a Declaration of independence 
 in 1818Independence  is a condition of a nation, country, or state  in which its residents and population, or some portion thereof,
exercise self-government, and usually sovereignty, over the territory. The opposite of independence is a dependent territory.
Independence does not necessarily mean freedom.[clarification needed]



DEFINITION OF INDEPENDENCE
Whether the attainment of independence is different from revolution  has long been contested, and has often been debated over the
question of violence  as a legitimate  means to achieving sovereignty.[1]  While some revolutions seek and achieve national
independence, others aim only to redistribute power — with or without an element of emancipation, such as in democratization  — 
within  a state, which as such may remain unaltered. Nation-states have been granted independence without any revolutionary acts.[

citation needed]  The Russian October Revolution, for example, was not intended to seek national independence (though it merely
transformed government for much of the former Russian Empire, it did result in independence for Poland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia 
 and Estonia). However, the American Revolutionary War  was intended to achieve independence from the beginning. Causes for a
country or province wishing to seek independence are many. The means can extend from peaceful demonstrations, like in the case of
the Indian independence movement, to a violent civil war.

DISTINCTION BETWEEN INDEPENDENCE AND AUTONOMY
Autonomy  refers to a kind of independence which has been granted by an overseeing authority  that itself still retains ultimate
authority over that territory (see Devolution). A protectorate  refers to an autonomous region that depends upon a larger
government for its protection as an autonomous region.

DECLARATIONS OF INDEPENDENCE
Sometimes, a state wishing to achieve independence from a dominating power will issue a declaration of independence; the earliest
surviving example is Scotland's Declaration of Arbroath  in 1320, with the most recent example being Azawad's declaration of
independence in 2012. Declaring independence and attaining it however, are quite different. A well-known successful example is the
 U.S. Declaration of Independence  issued in 1776. The dates of established independence (or, less commonly, the commencement of
revolution), are typically celebrated as a national holiday  known as an independence day.

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
Historically, there have been three major periods of declaring independence:

 * from the 1770s, beginning with the American Revolutionary War  through the 1830s, when the last royalist bastions fell at the
   close of the Spanish American wars of independence;
 * the immediate aftermath of the First World War  following the breakup of the Ottoman  and Austro-Hungarian  empires;
 * and 1945 to 1979, when seventy newly independent states emerged from the European colonial empires.[2]

ARTICLE NOTE
The dates of independence, as they have been ported into many articles from the CIA World Factbook  are defined as follows:

For most countries, [the given date is that] when sovereignty  was achieved ... For the other countries, the date given may not
represent "independence" in the strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such as the traditional founding date
or the date of unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or fundamental change in the form of government, such as 
state succession.Wikiquote has quotations related to: IndependenceThis article is about the concept of region in geography. For other uses, see Region (disambiguation).In geography, regions  are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact
characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic
regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human
geography, where jurisdiction  areas such as national borders are defined in law.

Apart from the global  continental  regions, there are also hydrospheric  and atmospheric  regions that cover the oceans, and
discrete climates  above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions
geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains  and features.

As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography,
each of which can describe areas in regional terms. For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural
region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on. The field of geography that studies regions themselves is
called regional geography.

In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on
natural features such as ecosystems  or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. Where 
human geography  is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography.

A region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.). The
second nature is its physical elements complex that were built by people in the past. The third nature is its socio-cultural
context that could not be replaced by new immigrants.[citation needed]



GLOBALIZATION
Global regions distinguishable from space, and are therefore clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land
and water. However, they have been generally recognised as such much earlier by terrestrial cartography  because of their impact
on human geography. They are divided into largest of land regions, known as continents, and the largest of water regions known as 
oceans. There are also significant regions that do not belong to either classification, such as archipelago  regions that are 
littoral  regions, or earthquake  regions that are defined in geology.

CONTINENTAL REGIONS
Continental regions are usually based on broad experiences in human history and attempts to reduce very large areas to more
manageable regionalization  for the purpose of study. As such they are conceptual constructs, usually lacking distinct boundaries.
Oceanic division into maritime regions are used in conjunction with the relationship to the central area of the continent, using
directions of the compass.

Some continental regions are defined by the major continental feature of their identity, such as the Amazon basin, or the Sahara,
which both occupy a significant percentage of their respective continental land area.

To a large extent, major continental regions are mental constructs created by considering an efficient way to define large areas
of the continents. For the most part, the images of the world are derived as much from academic study s the media[clarification
needed]  or from personal experience of global exploration. They are a matter of collective human knowledge of its own planet and
are attempts to better understand their environments.

REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY
Regional geography  is a branch of geography that studies regions of all sizes across the Earth. It has a prevailing descriptive
character. The main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region, which consists of natural
as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization, which covers the proper techniques of space delimitation 
into regions.

Regional geography is also considered as a certain approach to study in geographical sciences (similar to quantitative  or 
critical geographies; for more information, see history of geography).

HUMAN GEOGRAPHY
Human geography  is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape human interaction with
various discrete environments. It encompasses human, political, cultural, social, and economic  aspects among others that are
often clearly delineated. While the major focus of human geography is not the physical landscape of the Earth (see physical
geography), it is hardly possible to discuss human geography without referring to the physical landscape on which human activities
are being played out, and environmental geography  is emerging as a link between the two. Regions of human geography can be
divided into many broad categories:

 * Cultural geography
 * Demography
 * Development geography
 * Economic geography
 * Ethnography
 * Geopolitics
 * Health geography
 * Historical geography
 * Language geography
 * Religion geography
 * Social geography
 * Time geography
 * Tourism geography
 * Transportation geography
 * Urban geography

HISTORICAL REGIONS
The field of historical geography  involves the study of human history as it relates to places and regions  or the study of how
places and regions have changed over time.

D. W. Meinig, a historical geographer of America, describes many historical regions in his book The Shaping of America: A
Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History. For example, in identifying European "source regions" in early American
colonization efforts, he defines and describes the Northwest European Atlantic Protestant Region, which includes sub-regions such
as the "Western Channel Community", which itself is made of sub-regions such as the English West Country  of Cornwall, Devon, 
Somerset, and Dorset.

In describing historic regions of America, Meinig writes of "The Great Fishery" off the coast of Newfoundland and New England, an
oceanic region that includes the Grand Banks. He rejects regions traditionally used in describing American history, like New
France, "West Indies", the Middle Colonies, and the individual colonies themselves (Province of Maryland, for example). Instead he
writes of "discrete colonization areas," which may be named after colonies but rarely adhere strictly to political boundaries.
Historic regions of this type Meinig writes about include "Greater New England" and its major sub-regions of "Plymouth," "New
Haven shores" (including parts of Long Island), "Rhode Island" (or "Narragansett Bay"), "the Piscataqua," "Massachusetts Bay,"
"Connecticut Valley," and to a lesser degree, regions in the sphere of influence of Greater New England, "Acadia" (Nova Scotia),
"Newfoundland and The Fishery/The Banks."

Other examples of historical regions include Iroquoia, Ohio Country, Illinois Country, and Rupert's Land.

TOURISM REGION
Main article: Tourism regionA tourism region is a geographical region that has been designated by a governmental organization or tourism bureau  as having
common cultural or environmental characteristics. These regions are often named after a geographical, former, or current
administrative region or may have a name created for tourism  purposes. The names often evoke certain positive qualities of the
area and suggest a coherent tourism experience to visitors. Countries, states, provinces, and other administrative regions are
often carved up into tourism regions to facilitate attracting visitors.

Some of the more famous tourism regions based on historical or current administrative regions include Tuscany[1]  in Italy and 
Yucatán[2]  in Mexico. Famous examples of regions created by a government or tourism bureau include the United Kingdom's Lake
District[3]  and California's Wine Country.[4]  great plains region

NATURAL RESOURCE REGIONS
Natural resources  often occur in distinct regions. Natural resource regions can be a topic of physical geography or environmental
geography, but also have a strong element of human geography and economic geography. A coal region, for example, is a physical or
geomorphological region, but its development and exploitation can make it into an economic and a cultural region. Some examples of
natural resource regions include the Rumaila Field, the oil field that lies along the border or Iraq and Kuwait and played a role
in the Gulf War; the Coal Region  of Pennsylvania, which is a historical region as well as a cultural, physical, and natural
resource region; the South Wales Coalfield, which like Pennsylvania's coal region is a historical, cultural, and natural region;
the Kuznetsk Basin, a similarly important coal mining region in Russia; Kryvbas, the economic and iron ore mining region of
Ukraine; and the James Bay Project, a large region of Quebec where one of the largest hydroelectric systems in the world has been
developed.

RELIGIOUS REGIONS
Sometimes a region associated with a religion is given a name, like Christendom, a term with medieval and renaissance connotations
of Christianity as a sort of social and political polity. The term Muslim world  is sometimes used to refer to the region of the
world where Islam is dominant. These broad terms are very vague when used to describe regions.

Within some religions there are clearly defined regions. The Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, the Eastern Orthodox
Church, and others, define ecclesiastical regions with names such as diocese, eparchy, ecclesiastical provinces, and parish.

For example, the United States is divided into 32 Roman Catholic ecclesiastical provinces. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod  is
organized into 33 geographic districts, which are subdivided into circuits  (the Atlantic District (LCMS), for example). The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  uses regions similar to dioceses and parishes, but uses terms like ward  and stake.



POLITICAL REGIONS
In the field of political geography  regions tend to be based on political units such as sovereign states; subnational units such
as provinces, counties, townships, territories, etc.; and multinational groupings, including formally defined units such as the 
European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and NATO, as well as informally defined regions such as the Third
World, Western Europe, and the Middle East.

ADMINISTRATIVE REGIONS
The word "region" is taken from the Latin  regio  (derived from regere, to rule), and a number of countries have borrowed the term
as the formal name for a type of subnational entity  (e.g., the región, used in Chile). In English, the word is also used as the
conventional translation for equivalent terms in other languages (e.g., the область  (oblast), used in Russia alongside a broader
term регион).

The following countries use the term "region" (or its cognate) as the name of a type of subnational administrative unit:

 * Belgium  (in French, région; in German, Region; the Dutch  term gewest  is often translated as "region")
 * Chad  (région, effective from 2002)
 * Chile  (región)
 * Côte d'Ivoire  (région)
 * Denmark  (effective from 2007)
 * England  (not the United Kingdom as a whole)
 * Eritrea
 * France  (région)
 * Ghana
 * Guinea  (région)
 * Guinea-Bissau  (região)
 * Guyana
 * Hungary  (régió)
 * Italy  (regione)
 * Madagascar  (région)
 * Mali  (région)
 * Malta  (reġjun)
 * Namibia
 * New Zealand
 * Peru  (región)
 * Portugal  (região)
 * Philippines  (rehiyon)
 * Senegal  (région)
 * Tanzania
 * Togo  (région)
 * Trinidad and Tobago  (Regional Corporation)

The Canadian province  of Québec  also uses the "administrative region" (région administrative).

Scotland had local government regions  from 1975 to 1996.

In Spain the official name of the autonomous community  of Murcia  is Región de Murcia. Also, some single-province autonomous
communities such as Madrid  use the term región  interchangeably with comunidad autónoma.

Two län  (counties) in Sweden are officially called 'regions': Skåne  and Västra Götaland, and there is currently a controversial
proposal to divide the rest of Sweden into large regions, replacing the current counties.

The government of the Philippines  uses the term "region" (in Filipino, rehiyon) when it's necessary to group provinces, the
primary administrative subdivision of the country. This is also the case in Brazil, which groups its primary administrative
divisions (estados; "states") into grandes regiões  (greater regions) for statistical purposes, while Russia uses экономические
районы  (economic regions) in a similar way, as does Romania  and Venezuela.

The government of Singapore  makes use of the term "region" for its own administrative purposes.

The following countries use an administrative subdivision conventionally referred to as a region in English:

 * Bulgaria, which uses the област  (oblast)
 * Russia, which uses the область  (oblast'), and for some regions the край  (krai)
 * Ukraine, which uses the область  (oblast')
 * Slovakia  (kraj)

China has five 自治区 (zìzhìqū) and two 特別行政區 (or 特别行政区; tèbiéxíngzhèngqū), which are translated as "autonomous region" and "special
administrative region", respectively.

LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGIONS
There are many relatively small regions based on local government agencies such as districts, agencies, or regions. In general,
they are all regions in the general sense of being bounded spatial units. Examples include electoral districts such as 
Washington's 6th congressional district  and Tennessee's 1st congressional district; school districts such as Granite School
District  and Los Angeles Unified School District; economic districts such as the Reedy Creek Improvement District; metropolitan
areas such as the Seattle metropolitan area, and metropolitan districts such as the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of
Greater Chicago, the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District, the Metropolitan Police Service  of Greater London, as well as other
local districts like the York Rural Sanitary District, the Delaware River Port Authority, the Nassau County Soil and Water
Conservation District, and C-TRAN.

TRADITIONAL OR INFORMAL REGIONS
The traditional territorial divisions of some countries are also commonly rendered in English as "regions". These informal
divisions do not form the basis of the modern administrative divisions of these countries, but still define and delimit local
regional identity and sense of belonging. Examples include:

 * Finland
 * Japan
 * Korea
 * Norway  (landsdeler)
 * Romania
 * Slovakia

FUNCTIONAL REGIONS
Functional regions are usually understood to be the areas organised by the horizontal functional relations (flows, interactions)
that are maximised within a region and minimised across its borders so that the principles of internal cohesiveness and external
separation regarding spatial interactions are met (see, for instance, Farmer and Fotheringham, 2011;[5]  Klapka et al., 2013;[6] 
Smart, 1974[7]). A functional region is not an abstract spatial concept, but to a certain extent it can be regarded as a
reflection of the spatial behaviour of individuals in a geographic space. The functional region is conceived as a general concept
while its inner structure, inner spatial flows, and interactions need not necessarily show any regular pattern, only
selfcontainment. The concept of self-containment remains the only crucial defining characteristic of a functional region. Nodal
regions, functional urban regions, daily urban systems, local labour-market areas (LLMAs), or travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) are
considered to be special instances of a general functional region that need to fulfil some specific conditions regarding, for
instance, the character of the region-organising interaction or the presence of urban cores, (Halas et al., 2015[8]).

a region is shorthand for the name of a military formation  larger than an Army Group  and smaller than an Army Theater  or simply
Theater. The full name of the military formation is Army Region. The size of an Army Region can vary widely but is generally
somewhere between about 1 million and 3 million soldiers. Two or more Army Regions could make up an Army Theater. An Army Region
is typically commanded by a full General  (US four stars), a Field Marshal, or General of the Army  (US five stars), or 
Generalissimo  (Soviet Union). Due to the large size of this formation, its use is rarely employed. Some of the very few examples
of an Army Region are each of the Eastern, Western, and southern (mostly in Italy) fronts in Europe during World War II. The
military map unit symbol for this echelon of formation (see Military organization  and APP-6A) consists of six Xs.

A compass rose  with west highlightedWest  is one of the four cardinal directions  or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from east.



ETYMOLOGY
The word "West" is a Germanic  word passed into some Romance languages (ouest  in French, oest  in Catalan, ovest  in Italian, 
oeste  in Spanish and Portuguese). As is apparent in the Gothic term vasi  (Visigoths), it stems from the same Indo-European root
that gave the Sanskrit vas-ati  (night) and vesper  (evening) in Latin.

NAVIGATION
To go west using a compass for navigation, one needs to set a bearing  or azimuth  of 270°.

West is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the 
Sun  appears to constantly progress and eventually set.

Moving continuously west is following a circle of latitude.

CULTURAL
The phrase "the West" is often spoken in reference to the Western world, which includes the European Union  (also the EFTA 
countries), the Americas, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and (in part) South Africa.

The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the Western Roman Empire  and the Western Christianity. During the 
Cold War  "the West" was often used to refer to the NATO  camp as opposed to the Warsaw Pact  and non-aligned nations. The
expression survives, with an increasingly ambiguous meaning.

SYMBOLIC MEANINGS
In Chinese Buddhism, the West represents movement toward the Buddha  or enlightenment (see Journey to the West). The ancient 
Aztecs  believed that the West was the realm of the great goddess of water, mist, and maize. In Ancient Egypt, the West was
considered to be the portal to the netherworld, and is the cardinal direction regarded in connection with death, though not always
with a negative connotation. Ancient Egyptians also believed that the Goddess  Amunet  was a personification of the West.[1]  The 
Celts  believed that beyond the western sea off the edges of all maps lay the Otherworld, or Afterlife.

In Judaism, west is seen to be toward the Shekinah  (presence) of God, as in Jewish history the Tabernacle  and subsequent 
Jerusalem Temple  faced east, with God's Presence in the Holy of Holies  up the steps to the west. According to the Bible, the 
Israelites  crossed the Jordan River  westward into the Promised Land. In Islam, while in India, people pray facing towards the
west as in respect to India, Mecca  is in the West-ward direction.

In American literature  (e.g. in The Great Gatsby) moving West has sometimes symbolized gaining freedom, perhaps as an association
with the settling of the Old West  (see also Manifest Destiny).

 (Learn how and when to remove this template message)North  is a noun, adjective, or adverb  indicating direction  or geography. North is one of the four cardinal directions  or 
compass points. It is the opposite of south  and is perpendicular  to east  and west.



ETYMOLOGY
The word north  is related  to the Old High German  nord, both descending from the Proto-Indo-European  unit ner-, meaning "down"
(or "under"). (Presumably[according to whom?]  a natural primitive description of its concept is "to the left of the rising sun".)

The Latin word borealis  comes from the Greek  boreas  "north wind, north", which, according to Ovid, was personified as the son
of the river-god Strymon, the father of Calais and Zetes. Septentrionalis  is from septentriones, "the seven plow oxen", a name of
 Ursa Maior. The Greek arktikos  is named for the same constellation, and is the derivation of the English word "Arctic".

Other languages have sometimes more interesting derivations. For example, in Lezgian, kefer  can mean both 'disbelief' and
'north', since to the north of the Muslim Lezgian  homeland there are areas formerly inhabited by non-Muslim Caucasian and Turkic
peoples. In many languages of Mesoamerica, "north" also means "up". In Hungarian  the word for north is észak, which is derived
from éjszaka  ("night"), since above the Tropic of Cancer, the Sun  never shines from the north, except inside the Arctic Circle 
during the summer midnight sun.

The direction north is often associated with colder climates due to the fact that most of the world's land at high latitudes are
located in the northern hemisphere.

MAPPING
By convention, the top side of a map  is often north.

To go north using a compass for navigation, set a bearing  or azimuth  of 0° or 360°.

North is specifically the direction that, in Western culture, is treated as the  fundamental direction:

 * North is used (explicitly or implicitly) to define all other directions.
 * The (visual) top edges of maps  usually correspond to the northern edge of the area represented, unless explicitly stated
   otherwise or landmarks  are considered more useful for that territory than specific directions.
 * On any rotating non-astronomical object, north  denotes the side appearing to rotate counter-clockwise  when viewed from afar
   along the axis of rotation.

MAGNETIC NORTH AND DECLINATION
Magnetic north  is of interest because it is the direction indicated as north on a properly functioning (but uncorrected) magnetic
 compass. The difference between it and true north  is called the magnetic declination  (or simply the declination where the
context is clear). For many purposes and physical circumstances, the error in direction that results from ignoring the distinction
is tolerable; in others a mental or instrument compensation, based on assumed knowledge of the applicable declination, can solve
all the problems. But simple generalizations on the subject should be treated as unsound, and as likely to reflect popular
misconceptions about terrestrial magnetism.

Maps intended for usage in orienteering by compass will clearly indicate the local declination for easy correction to true north.
Maps may also indicate grid north, which is a navigational term referring to the direction northwards along the grid lines of a 
map projection.

ROLES OF NORTH AS PRIME DIRECTION
The visible rotation of the night sky around the visible celestial pole  provides a vivid metaphor of that direction corresponding
to up. Thus the choice of the north as corresponding to up in the northern hemisphere, or of south in that role in the southern,
is, prior to world-wide communication, anything but an arbitrary one. On the contrary, it is of interest that Chinese and Islamic
culture even considered south as the proper top end for maps.[citation needed]

In Western culture:

 * Maps tend to be drawn for viewing with either true north or magnetic north at the top
 * Globes  of the earth have the North Pole at the top, or if the Earth's axis is represented as inclined from vertical (normally
   by the angle it has relative to the axis of the Earth's orbit), in the top half.
 * Maps are usually labelled to indicate which direction on the map corresponds to a direction on the earth, * usually with a
      single arrow oriented to the map's representation of true north,
    * occasionally with a
      single arrow oriented to the map's representation of magnetic north, or two arrows oriented to true and magnetic north
      respectively,
    * occasionally with a
       compass rose, but if so, usually on a map with north at the top and usually with north decorated more prominently than any
      other compass point.
   
   
 * Up is a metaphor for north. The notion that north should always be up and east at the right was established by the Greek
   astronomer Ptolemy. The historian Daniel Boorstin  suggests that perhaps this was because the better-known places in his world
   were in the northern hemisphere, and on a flat map these were most convenient for study if they were in the upper right-hand
   corner.[1]

ROLES OF EAST AND WEST AS INHERENTLY SUBSIDIARY DIRECTIONS
While the choice of north over south as prime direction reflects quite arbitrary historical factors,[which?]  east and west are
not nearly as natural alternatives as first glance might suggest. Their folk definitions are, respectively, "where the sun rises"
and "where it sets". Except on the Equator, however, these definitions, taken together, would imply that

 * east and west would not be 180 degrees apart, but instead would differ from that by up to twice the degrees of latitude of the
   location in question, and
 * they would each move slightly from day to day and, in the temperate zones, markedly over the course of the year.

Reasonably accurate folk astronomy, such as is usually attributed to Stone Age  peoples or later Celts, would arrive at east and
west by noting the directions of rising and setting (preferably more than once each) and choosing as prime direction one of the
two mutually opposite directions that lie halfway between those two. The true folk-astronomical definitions of east and west are
"the directions, a right angle from the prime direction, that are closest to the rising and setting, respectively, of the sun (or
moon).

CULTURAL REFERENCES
Being the "default" direction on the compass, north is referred to frequently in Western popular culture. Some examples include:

 * The phrase "north of X" is often used by Americans to mean "more than X" or "greater than X", i.e. "The world population is
   north of 7 billion people" or "north of 40 [years old]".

A 16-point compass rose  with south at the bottom.South  is a noun, adjective, or adverb  indicating direction  or geography. It is one of the four cardinal directions  or compass
points. South is the polar opposite of north  and is perpendicular  to east  and west.



ETYMOLOGY
The word south  comes from Old English  sūþ, from earlier Proto-Germanic  *sunþaz  ("south"), possibly related to the same 
Proto-Indo-European  root that the word sun  derived from.

NAVIGATION
By convention, the bottom side of a map  is south, although reversed maps  exist that defy this convention.[1]  To go south using
a compass for navigation, set a bearing  or azimuth  of 180°. Alternatively, in the Northern Hemisphere  outside the tropics, the 
Sun  will be roughly in the south at midday.[2]

True south is the direction towards the southern end of the axis about which the earth  rotates, called the South Pole. The South
Pole is located in Antarctica. Magnetic south  is the direction towards the south magnetic pole, some distance away from the south
geographic pole.[3]

Roald Amundsen, from Norway, was the first to reach the South Pole, on 14 December 1911, after Ernest Shackleton  from the UK  was
forced to turn back some distance short.[4]

GEOGRAPHY
The Global South  refers to the socially and economically less-developed southern half of the globe. 95% of the Global North has
enough food and shelter, and a functioning education system.[5]  In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has
enough food and shelter. It "lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and
their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports."[5]

Use of the term 'South' may also be country-relative, particularly in cases of noticeable economic or cultural divide - for
example the Southern United States, separated from the Northeastern United States  by the Mason–Dixon line, or the South of
England, which is politically and economically unmatched with all of the North of England.

OTHER USES
In the card game bridge, one of the players is known for scoring purposes as South. South partners with North and plays against
East and West.[6]

In Greek religion, Notos, was the south wind and bringer of the storms of late summer and autumn.

You may need rendering support  to display the Persian text  in this article correctly.Iran  (/aɪˈræn/  or i/ɪˈrɑːn/;[11]  Persian: ایران‎‎ Irān  [ʔiːˈɾɒːn] (  listen)), also known as Persia  (/ˈpɜːrʒə/  or /ˈpɜːrʃə/
),[12]  officially known as the Islamic Republic of Iran  (جمهوری اسلامی ایران  Jomhuri ye Eslāmi ye Irān  [d͡ʒomhuːˌɾiːje
eslɒːˌmiːje ʔiːˈɾɒːn]), is a sovereign state  in Western Asia.[13][14]  It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the de facto  
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan  and Pakistan; to the
south by the Persian Gulf  and the Gulf of Oman; to the north by the Caspian Sea; and to the west by Turkey  and Iraq. Comprising
a land area of 1,648,195 km2  (636,372 sq mi), it is the second-largest country in the Middle East  and the 18th-largest in the
world. With 78.4 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country.[15][16]  It is the only country with both a 
Caspian Sea  and an Indian Ocean  coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the 
Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic  importance.[17]  Tehran  is the country's capital and largest city as well as its
leading economic center.

Iran is heir to one of the world's oldest civilizations,[18][19]  beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite  and Elamite 
kingdoms in 3200–2800 BC. The area was first unified by the Iranian  Medes  in 625 BC, who became the dominant cultural and
political power in the region.[4]  Iran reached its greatest geographic extent during the Achaemenid Empire  founded by Cyrus the
Great  in 550 BC, which at one time stretched from parts of Eastern Europe  in the west, to the Indus Valley  in the east, making
it the largest empire the world had yet seen.[20]  The empire collapsed in 330 BC following the conquests of Alexander the Great,
but reemerged shortly after as the Parthian Empire. Under the Sassanid Dynasty, Iran again became one of the leading powers in the
world for the next four centuries.[21][22]

Beginning in 633 AD, Rashidun Arabs conquered Iran  and largely displaced the indigenous faiths of Manichaeism  and Zoroastrianism 
 by Sunni Islam. Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age  that followed, producing many influential scientists,
scholars, artists, and thinkers. The rise of the Safavid Dynasty  in 1501 led to the establishment  of Twelver Shia  Islam as the
official religion of Iran, marking one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history.[6][23]  During the 18th
century, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, and under Nader Shah  briefly possessed what was
arguably the most powerful empire at the time.[24]  Through the late 18th and 19th centuries, a series of conflicts with Russia 
led to significant territorial losses and the erosion of sovereignty.[25][26]  Popular unrest culminated in the Persian
Constitutional Revolution  of 1906, which established a constitutional monarchy  and the country's first legislative body, the 
Majles. Following a coup d'état instigated by the U.K. and the U.S.  in 1953, Iran gradually became closely aligned with the West
but grew increasingly autocratic.[27]  Growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression led to the 1979
Revolution  and the establishment of an Islamic republic.[16]

Iran is a major regional  and middle power,[28][29]  and its large reserves of fossil fuels  — which include the largest natural
gas supply  in the world and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves[30][31]  — exert considerable influence in international
energy security  and the world economy. Iran's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 21 UNESCO World Heritage Sites,
the third-largest number in Asia and 11th-largest in the world.[32]

Iran is a founding member of the UN, ECO, NAM, OIC, and OPEC. Its political system  is based on the 1979 Constitution  which
combines elements of a parliamentary democracy  with a theocracy  governed by Islamic jurists  under the concept of a Supreme
Leadership. A multicultural country  comprising numerous ethnic and linguistic groups, most inhabitants are Shia Muslims  and 
Persian  is the official language.[33]



ETYMOLOGY
Main article: Name of IranThe term Iran  derives directly from Middle Persian  Ērān, first attested in a 3rd-century inscription at Rustam Relief, with the
accompanying Parthian  inscription using the term Aryān, in reference to Iranians.[34]  The Middle Iranian  ērān  and aryān  are
oblique plural forms of gentilic  ēr-  (Middle Persian) and ary-  (Parthian), both deriving from Proto-Iranian  *arya-  (meaning "

Aryan", i.e. "of the Iranians"),[34][35]  argued to descend from Proto-Indo-European  *ar-yo-, meaning "skillful assembler".[36] 
In the Iranian languages, the gentilic is attested as a self-identifier included in ancient inscriptions and the literature of 
Avesta,[37][a]  and remains also in other Iranian ethnic names such as Alans  (Ossetic: Ир – Ir) and Iron  (Ossetic: Ирон – Iron).

[35]

Historically, Iran has been referred to as Persia  by the West, due mainly to the writings of Greek  historians who called Iran 
Persis  (Greek: Περσίς),[38]  meaning "land of the Persians". As the most extensive interactions the Ancient Greeks  had with any
outsider was with the Persians, the term persisted, even long after the Persian rule in Greece. However, Persis  (Old Persian: 
Pārśa; Modern Persian: Pārse) was originally referred to a region settled by Persians in the west shore of Lake Urmia, in the 9th
century BC. The settlement was then shifted to the southern end of the Zagros Mountains, and is today defined as Fars Province.

In 1935, Reza Shah  requested the international community to refer to the country by its native name, Iran. As the New York Times 
explained at the time, "At the suggestion of the Persian Legation in Berlin, the Tehran government, on the Persian New Year, 
Nowruz, March 21, 1935, substituted Iran  for Persia  as the official name of the country." Opposition to the name change led to
the reversal of the decision, and Professor Ehsan Yarshater, editor of Encyclopædia Iranica, propagated a move to use Persia  and 
Iran  interchangeably.[39]  Today, both Persia  and Iran  are used in cultural contexts; although, Iran  is the name used
officially in political contexts.[40]

Historical and cultural usage of the word Iran  is not restricted to the modern state proper.[41][42][43]  "Greater Iran" (
Irānzamīn  or Irān e Bozorg)[44]  correspond to territories of the Iranian cultural and linguistic zones. In addition to modern
Iran, it includes portions of the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and Central Asia.[45]

HISTORY
Main article: History of IranPREHISTORY
A cave painting  in Doushe cave, Lorestan, from the 8th millennium BC.Further information: Prehistory of Iran  and Archaeological
sites in IranThe earliest archaeological artifacts in Iran, like those excavated at the Kashafrud  and Ganj Par  sites, attest to a human
presence in Iran since the Lower Paleolithic  era, c. 800,000–200,000 BC.[46]  Iran's Neanderthal  artifacts from the Middle
Paleolithic  period, c. 200,000–40,000 BC, have been found mainly in the Zagros  region, at sites such as Warwasi  and Yafteh Cave
.[47][48][page needed]  Around 10th  to 8th millennium BC, early agricultural communities such as Chogha Golan  and Chogha Bonut 
began to flourish in Iran,[49][50][51][52]  as well as Susa  and Chogha Mish  developing in and around the Zagros region.[53][
page needed][54][55]

The emergence of Susa as a city, as determined by radiocarbon dating, dates back to early 4,395 BC.[56]  There are dozens of
prehistoric sites across the Iranian plateau, pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the 4th
millennium BC.[55][57][58]  During the Bronze Age, Iran was home to several civilizations including Elam, Jiroft, and Zayande
River. Elam, the most prominent of these civilizations, developed in the southwest of Iran, alongside those in Mesopotamia. The
emergence of writing in Elam was paralleled to Sumer, and the Elamite cuneiform  was developed since the 3rd millennium BC.[59]

The Elamite Kingdom continued its existence until the emergence of the Median  and Achaemenid  empires. Between 3400 BC until
about 2000 BC, northwestern Iran was part of the Kura-Araxes culture  that stretched into the neighbouring regions of the Caucasus 
 and Anatolia. Since the earliest 2nd millennium BC, Assyrians  settled in swaths of western Iran, and incorporated the region
into their territories.[citation needed]

Modern impression of an Achaemenid cylinder seal  from the 5th century BC, depicting a winged solar disc legitimizing the
conquering Persian king who subdues two rampant Mesopotamian lamassu  figures.During the 2nd millennium BC, Proto-Iranian  tribes arrived in Iran from the Eurasian steppes,[60]  rivaling the native settlers
of the country.[61][62]  As these tribes  dispersed into the wider area of Greater Iran  and beyond, the boundaries of modern Iran
were dominated by the Persian, Median  and Parthian  tribes.

From the late 10th to late 7th centuries BC, the Iranian peoples, together with the pre-Iranian kingdoms, fell under the
domination of the Assyrian Empire, based in northern Mesopotamia.[63]  Under king Cyaxares, the Medes and Persians entered into an
alliance with Nabopolassar  of Babylon, as well as the Scythians  and the Cimmerians, and together they attacked the Assyrian
Empire. The civil war ravaged the Assyrian Empire between 616 BC and 605 BC, thus freeing their respective peoples from three
centuries of Assyrian rule.[63]  The unification of the Median tribes under a single ruler  in 728 BC led to the foundation of the
 Median Empire  which, by 612 BC, controlled the whole Iran and the eastern Anatolia.[64]  This marked the end of the Kingdom of
Urartu  as well, which was subsequently conquered and dissolved.[65][66]

Tomb of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, Pasargadae.
Ruins of the Gate of All Nations, Persepolis.In 550 BC, Cyrus the Great, son of Mandane  and Cambyses I, took over the Median Empire, and founded the Achaemenid Empire  by
unifying other city states. The conquest of Media was a result of what is called the Persian Revolt. The brouhaha  was initially
triggered by the actions of the Median ruler Astyages, and was quickly spread to other provinces, as they allied with the
Persians. Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include Lydia, Babylon, Egypt, parts of the 
Balkans  and Eastern Europe  proper, as well as the lands to the west of the Indus  and Oxus  rivers.

539 BC was the year in which Persian forces defeated the Babylonian army at Opis, and marked the end of around four centuries of
Mesopotamian domination of the region with the transition from the Neo-Babylonian Period to the Achaemenid Period. Cyrus entered
Babylon and presented himself as a traditional Mesopotamian monarch. Subsequent Achaemenid art and iconography reflect the
influence of the new political reality in Mesopotamia.

Achaemenid Empire around the time of Darius I  and Xerxes I.At its greatest extent, the Achaemenid Empire included the modern
territories of Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, much of the Black Sea  coastal regions, northeastern Greece  and
southern Bulgaria  (Thrace), northern Greece and Macedonia  (Paeonia  and Ancient Macedon), Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, 
Palestine, all significant ancient population centers of ancient Egypt  as far west as Libya, Kuwait, northern Saudi Arabia, parts
of the UAE  and Oman, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and much of Central Asia, making it the first world government  and the largest
empire the world had yet seen.[20]

It is estimated that in 480 BC, 50 million people lived in the Achaemenid Empire.[67][68]  The empire at its peak ruled over 44%
of the world's population, the highest such figure for any empire in history.[69]  In Greek history, the Achaemenid Empire is
considered as the antagonist  of the Greek city states, for the emancipation of slaves including the Jewish  exiles in Babylon,
building infrastructures such as road  and postal  systems, and the use of an official language, the Imperial Aramaic, throughout
its territories.[20]  The empire had a centralized, bureaucratic administration under the emperor, a large professional army, and
civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires.[70][71]  Furthermore, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
World, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, was built in the empire between 353 and 350 BC.

Eventual conflict on the western borders began with the Ionian Revolt  which erupted into the Greco-Persian Wars, and continued
through the first half of the 5th century BC, and ended with the Persian withdrawal from all of their European territories in the 
Balkans  and Eastern Europe  proper.[72]

In 334 BC, Alexander the Great  invaded the Achaemenid Empire, defeating the last Achaemenid emperor, Darius III, at the Battle
of
Issus. Following the premature death of Alexander, Iran came under the control of the Hellenistic  Seleucid Empire. In the middle
of the 2nd century BC, the Parthian Empire  rose to become the main power in Iran, and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry
between Romans and Parthians began, culminating in the Roman–Parthian Wars. The Parthian Empire continued as a feudal monarchy for
nearly five centuries, until 224 CE, when it was succeeded by the Sassanid Empire.[73]  Together with their neighboring
arch-rival, the Roman-Byzantines, they made up the world's two most dominant powers at the time, for over four centuries.[21][22]

Sassanid reliefs  at Taq Bostan.The Sassanids established an empire within the frontiers achieved by the Achaemenids, with their
capital at Ctesiphon. The Sassanid Empire of the Late Antiquity  is considered as one of the most influential periods of Iran, as
Iran influenced the culture of ancient Rome  (and through that as far as Western Europe),[74][75]  Africa,[76]  China, and India,
[77]  and played a prominent role in the formation of both European  and Asian  medieval art.[78]

A bas-relief at Naqsh-e Rostam, depicting the victory of Shapur I  over Valerian  following the Battle of Edessa.Most of the era
of both Parthian and Sassanid empires were overshadowed by the Roman-Persian Wars, which raged on their western borders at the 
Anatolia, the western Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and the Levant, for over 700 years. These wars exhausted both Romans and Sassanids,
and led to the defeat of both at the hands of the invading Muslim Arabs.

Several offshoots of the Achaemenids, Parthians, and Sassanids, established eponymous  dynasties and branches in Anatolia and the
Caucasus, including the Kingdom of Pontus, the Mihranids, and the Arsacid dynasties of Armenia, Iberia  (Georgia), and Caucasian
Albania  (present-day Azerbaijan  and southern Dagestan).

MEDIEVAL PERIOD
Main articles: Muslim conquest of Persia  and Medieval IranThe prolonged Byzantine-Sassanid Wars, most importantly the climactic Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602-628, as well as the social
conflict within the Sassanid Empire, opened the way for an Arab invasion to Iran in the 7th century.[79][80]  Initially defeated
by the Arab Rashidun Caliphate, Iran came under the rule of the Arab caliphates of Umayyad  and Abbasid. The prolonged and gradual
process of the Islamization of Iran  began following the conquest. Under the new Arab elite of the Rashidun and later the Umayyad
caliphates, both converted (mawali) and non-converted (dhimmi) Iranians were discriminated against, being excluded from the
government and military, and having to pay a special tax called Jizya.[81][82]  Gunde Shapur, home of the Academy of Gunde Shapur 
which was the most important medical center of the world at the time, survived after the invasion, but became known as an Islamic
institute thereafter.[83]

Tomb of Hafez, the popular Iranian poet  whose works are regarded as a pinnacle in Persian literature  and have left a
considerable mark on later Western writers, most notably Goethe, Thoreau  and Emerson.[84][85][86]In 750, the Abbasids  overthrew the Umayyads, due mainly to the support from the mawali Iranians.[87]  The mawali formed the
majority of the rebel army, which was led by the Iranian general Abu Muslim.[88][89][90]  The arrival of the Abbasid Caliphs saw a
revival of Iranian culture  and influence, and a move away from the imposed Arabic customs. The role of the old Arab aristocracy
was gradually replaced by an Iranian bureaucracy.[91]

After two centuries of the Arab rule, semi-independent and independent Iranian kingdoms such as the Tahirids, Saffarids, Samanids,
and Buyids  began to appear on the fringes of the declining Abbasid Caliphate. By the Samanid era in the 9th and 10th centuries,
the efforts of Iranians to regain their independence had been well solidified.[92]

The blossoming literature, philosophy, medicine, and art  of Iran became major elements in the formation of a new age for the
Iranian civilization, during the period known as the Islamic Golden Age.[93][94]  The Islamic Golden Age reached its peak by the
10th and 11th centuries, during which Iran was the main theater of the scientific activities.[83]  After the 10th century, the 
Persian language, alongside Arabic, was used for the scientific, philosophical, historical, musical, and medical works, whereas
the important Iranian writers, such as Tusi, Avicenna, Qotb od Din Shirazi, and Biruni, had major contributions in the scientific
writing.

The cultural revival that began in the Abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the Iranian national identity, and so earlier
attempts of Arabization  never succeeded in Iran. The Iranian Shuubiyah  movement became a catalyst for Iranians to regain
independence in their relations with the Arab invaders.[95]  The most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the 
Persian language  attested to the epic poet Ferdowsi, now regarded as the most important figure in Iranian literature.

Tuğrul Tower, a 12th-century monument in Rey, Iran.The 10th century saw a mass migration of Turkic tribes  from Central Asia  into the Iranian plateau.[96]  Turkic tribesmen were
first used in the Abbasid army as mamluks  (slave-warriors), replacing Iranian and Arab elements within the army.[88]  As a
result, the mamluks gained a significant political power. In 999, large portions of Iran came briefly under the rule of the 
Ghaznavids, whose rulers were of mamluk Turk origin, and longer subsequently under the Turkish Seljuk  and Khwarezmian  empires.
These Turks had been Persianized  and had adopted Persian models of administration and rulership.[96]  The Seljuks subsequently
gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum  in Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them.[97][98]  The result
of the adoption and patronage of Persian culture  by Turkish rulers was the development of a distinct Turko-Persian tradition.

In 1219–21 the Khwarezmian Empire  suffered a devastating invasion  by the Mongol  army of Genghis Khan. According to Steven R.
Ward, "Mongol violence and depredations  killed up to three-fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau, possibly 10 to 15
million people. Some historians have estimated that Iran's population did not again reach its pre-Mongol levels until the mid-20th
century."[99]

Following the fracture of the Mongol Empire in 1256, Hulagu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, established the Ilkhanate  in Iran. In
1370, yet another conqueror, Timur, followed the example of Hulagu, establishing the Timurid Empire  which lasted for another 156
years. In 1387, Timur ordered the complete massacre of Isfahan, reportedly killing 70,000 citizens.[100]  The Ilkhans  and the 
Timurids  soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the Iranians, choosing to surround themselves with a culture that was
distinctively Iranian.[101]

EARLY MODERN PERIOD
Main articles: Safavid dynasty, Afsharid dynasty, Zand dynasty, and Qajar dynasty
A Venetian  portrait of Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid dynasty. – The UffiziBy the 1500s, Ismail I  from Ardabil, established the Safavid dynasty, with Tabriz  as the capital.[96]  Beginning with
Azerbaijan, he subsequently extended his authority over all of the Iranian territories, and established an intermittent Iranian
hegemony over the vast relative regions, reasserting the Iranian identity within large parts of the Greater Iran.[102]  Iran was
predominantly Sunni,[103]  but Ismail instigated a forced conversion  to the Shia  branch of Islam,[104]  by which the Shia Islam
spread throughout the Safavid territories in the Caucasus, Iran, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia. As a result, thereof, the modern-day
Iran is the only official Shia nation of the world, with it holding an absolute majority in Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan,
having there the 1st and 2nd highest number of Shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world.[105][106]

The centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire, led to numerous 
Ottoman–Persian Wars.[99]  The Safavid Era peaked in the reign of Abbas the Great, 1587–1629,[99][107]  surpassing their Ottoman
archrivals in strength, and making the empire a leading hub in Western Eurasia for the sciences and arts. The Safavid Era saw the
start of mass integration from Caucasian populations  into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them
within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in
the late 1600s and early 1700s, which was caused by the internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign
interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the Pashtun rebels  who besieged Isfahan and
defeated Soltan Hosein  in 1722.

Statue of Nader Shah, the founder of the Afsharid dynasty. – Naderi MuseumIn 1729, Nader Shah, a chieftain and military genius from Khorasan, successfully drove out and conquered the Pashtun invaders. He
subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which were divided  among the Ottoman and Russian  authorities by the
ongoing chaos in Iran. During the reign of Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sassanid Empire, reestablishing
the Iranian hegemony all over the Caucasus, as well as other major parts of the west  and central  Asia, and briefly possessing
what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time.[24]

Nader Shah invaded India and sacked far off Delhi  by the late 1730s. His territorial expansion, as well as his military
successes, went into a decline following the final campaigns in the Northern Caucasus. The assassination of Nader Shah sparked a
brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which Karim Khan  of the Zand dynasty  came to power in 1750, bringing a period of
relative peace and prosperity.[99]

The geopolitical reach of the Zand dynasty was limited, compared to its preceding dynasties. Many of the Iranian territories in
the Caucasus gained de facto  independence and were locally ruled through various Caucasian khanates. However, despite the
self-ruling, they all remained subjects  and vassals to the Zand king.[108]  The khanates exercised control over their affairs via
international trade routes between Central Asia and the West.[109]

Another civil war ensued after the death of Karim Khan in 1779, out of which Aqa Mohammad Khan  emerged, founding the Qajar
dynasty  in 1794. In 1795, following the disobedience of the Georgian  subjects and their alliance with the Russians, the Qajars
captured Tblisi  by the Battle of Krtsanisi, and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus, reestablishing the Iranian 
suzerainty  over the region.

A map showing the northwestern borders of Iran in the 19th century, comprising modern-day Eastern Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia  and 
Azerbaijan, before being ceded to neighboring Imperial Russia  by the Russo-Persian Wars.The Russo-Persian wars of 1804–1813  and 1826–1828  resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus,
comprising all of Transcaucasia  and Dagestan, which made part of the very concept of Iran for centuries,[25]  and thus
substantial gains for the neighboring Russian Empire.

As a result of the 19th century Russo-Persian wars, the Russians took over the Caucasus, and Iran irrevocably lost control over
its integral territories in the region (comprising modern-day Dagestan, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan), which got confirmed per
the treaties of Gulistan  and Turkmenchay.[26][110]  The area to the north of the river Aras, among which the contemporary
Republic of Azerbaijan, eastern Georgia, Dagestan, and Armenia, were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the
course of the 19th century.[26][111][112][113][114][115][116]

As Iran shrank, many Transcaucasian  and North Caucasian  Muslims moved towards Iran,[117][118]  especially until the aftermath 
result of the Caucasian War,[118]  and the decades afterwards, while Iran's Armenians were encouraged to settle in the newly
incorporated Russian territories,[119][120][121]  causing significant demographic shifts.

Around 1.5 million people—20 to 25% of the population of Iran—died as a result of the Great Famine of 1870–1871.[122]

The first national parliament of Iran, established in 1906.Between 1872 and 1905, a series of protests took place in response to
the sale of concessions  to foreigners by Qajar monarchs Nasser ed Din  and Mozaffar ed Din, and led to the Iranian
Constitutional
Revolution. The first Iranian Constitution  and the first national parliament of Iran  were founded in 1906, through the ongoing
revolution. The Constitution included the official recognition of Iran's three religious minorities, namely Christians, 
Zoroastrians, and Jews,[123]  which has remained a basis in the legislation of Iran since then.

The struggle related to the constitutional movement continued until 1911, when Mohammad Ali Shah  was defeated and forced to
abdicate. On the pretext of restoring order, the Russians occupied northern Iran in 1911, and maintained a military presence in
the region for years to come. During World War I, the British occupied much of the territory of western Iran, and fully withdrew
in 1921. The Persian Campaign  commenced furthermore during World War I in northwestern Iran after an Ottoman invasion, as part of
the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. As a result of Ottoman hostilities across the border, a large amount of the Assyrians
of Iran were massacred  by the Ottoman armies, notably in and around Urmia.[124][125]  Apart from the rule of Aqa Mohammad Khan,
the Qajar rule is characterized as a century of misrule.[96]

The Iranian Cossack Brigade, which was the most effective military force available to the crown, began a military coup  supported
by the British in February 1921. The Qajar dynasty was subsequently overthrown, and Reza Khan, the former general of the Iranian
Cossack Brigade, became the new Prime Minister of Iran. Eventually, he was declared the new monarch in 1925—thence known as Reza
Shah—establishing the Pahlavi dynasty.

In the midst of World War II  in 1941, Nazi Germany  began the so-called Operation Barbarossa  and invaded the Soviet Union,
breaking the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. This had a major impact on Iran, which had declared neutrality in the conflicts.[126]  Later
that year, following an Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, Reza Shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
.[127][128]  Subsequently, Iran became a major conduit  for British and American aid  to the Soviet Union until the end of the
ongoing war.[129]

The Allied  "Big Three" at the 1943 Tehran Conference.At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied  "Big Three" (Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill) issued the 
Tehran Declaration  to guarantee the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran. However, at the end of the war, Soviet troops
remained in Iran and local pro-Soviet groups established two puppet states in northwestern Iran, namely the People's Government
of
Azerbaijan  and the Republic of Mahabad. Receiving a promise of oil concessions, the Soviets withdraw from Iran proper in May
1946. The two puppet states were soon overthrown following the Iran crisis of 1946, and the oil concessions were revoked.[130]

CONTEMPORARY ERA
Main articles: 1953 Iranian coup d'état, 1979 Revolution, and History of the Islamic Republic of IranMohammad Mosaddegh, Iranian
democracy advocate and deposed Prime Minister.In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh  was elected as the prime minister. He became enormously popular in Iran, after he nationalized  
Iran's petroleum industry  and oil reserves. He was deposed in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, an Anglo-American covert operation
that marked the first time the US had overthrown a foreign government during the Cold War.[132]

Mohammad Reza Pahlavi  and the Imperial Family during the coronation ceremony of the Shah of Iran in 1967.After the coup, the Shah
became increasingly autocratic  and sultanistic, and Iran entered a phase of decades long controversial close relations  with the
United States and some other foreign governments.[133]  While the Shah increasingly modernized Iran and claimed to retain it as a
fully secular state,[27]  arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police, the SAVAK, were used to crush all forms of political
opposition.

Ruhollah Khomeini, a radical Muslim cleric, became an active critic of the Shah's far-reaching series of reforms known as the 
White Revolution. Khomeini publicly denounced the government, and was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months. After his release in
1964, he refused to apologize, and was eventually sent into exile.

Due to the 1973 spike in oil prices, the economy of Iran was flooded with foreign currency, which caused inflation. By 1974, the
economy of Iran was experiencing double digit inflation, and despite the many large projects to modernize the country, corruption
was rampant and caused large amounts of waste. By 1975 and 1976, an economic recession  led to increased unemployment, especially
among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of Iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early
1970s. By the late 1970s, many of these people opposed the Shah's regime and began to organize and join the protests against it.
[134]

Ruhollah Khomeini  returning to Iran from exile, on February 1, 1979.The 1979 Revolution, later known as the Islamic Revolution,[135][136][137]  began in January 1978 with the first major
demonstrations against the Shah.[138]  After a year of strikes  and demonstrations  paralyzing the country and its economy, 
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled the country and Ruhollah Khomeini returned  from exile to Tehran in February 1979, forming a new
government.[139]  After holding a referendum, Iran officially became an Islamic republic  in April 1979.[140]  A second referendum 
 in December 1979 approved a theocratic constitution.[141]

The immediate nationwide uprisings against the new government began by the 1979 Kurdish rebellion  with the Khuzestan uprisings,
along with the uprisings in Sistan and Baluchestan Province  and other areas. Over the next several years, these uprisings were
subdued in a violent manner by the new Islamic government. The new government began purging itself of the non-Islamist political
opposition, as well as of those Islamists who were not considered radical enough. Although both nationalists and Marxists had
initially joined with Islamists to overthrow the Shah, tens of thousands were executed by the new regime afterwards.[142]

On November 4, 1979, a group of Muslim students  seized the United States Embassy and took the embassy with 52 personnel and
citizens hostage,[143]  after the United States refused to return Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to Iran to face trial in the court of the
new regime and all but certain execution. Attempts by the Jimmy Carter  administration to negotiate for the release of the
hostages, and a failed rescue attempt, helped force Carter out of office and brought Ronald Reagan  to power. On Jimmy Carter's
final day in office, the last hostages were finally set free as a result of the Algiers Accords.

The Cultural Revolution  began in 1980, with an initial closure of universities for three years, in order to perform an inspection
and cleanup in the cultural policy of the education and training system.[144]

On September 22, 1980, the Iraqi army invaded the Iranian Khuzestan, and the Iran–Iraq War  began. Although the forces of Saddam
Hussein made several early advances, by mid 1982, the Iranian forces successfully managed to drive the Iraqi army back  into Iraq.
In July 1982, with Iraq thrown on the defensive, Iran took the decision to invade Iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid
to conquer Iraqi territory and capture cities, such as Basra. The war continued until 1988, when the Iraqi army defeated the
Iranian forces inside Iraq and pushed the remaining Iranian troops back across the border. Subsequently, Khomeini accepted a 
truce
mediated by the UN. The total Iranian casualties in the war were estimated to be 123,220–160,000 KIA, 60,711 MIA, and
11,000–16,000 civilians killed.[145][146]

The Silent Demonstration  during the 2009–10 Iranian election protests.Following the Iran–Iraq War, in 1989, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani  and his administration concentrated on a pragmatic pro-business
policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution. In 1997,
Rafsanjani was succeeded by the moderate reformist  Mohammad Khatami, whose government attempted, unsuccessfully, to make the
country more free and democratic.[147]

The 2005 presidential election  brought conservative populist candidate, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to power.[148]  During the 2009
Iranian presidential election, the Interior Ministry  announced incumbent president Ahmadinejad had won 62.63% of the vote, while 
Mir-Hossein Mousavi  had come in second place with 33.75%.[149][150]  Allegations of large irregularities and fraud provoked the 
2009 Iranian presidential election protests, both within Iran and in major cites outside the country.[151]

Hassan Rouhani  was elected as President of Iran  on June 15, 2013, defeating Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf  and four other candidates.

[152][153]  The electoral victory of Rouhani has improved the relations of Iran with other countries.[154]

GEOGRAPHY
Main article: Geography of IranSee also: Agriculture in Iran  and Wildlife of Iran
Provinces of Iran by area (km2).Iran has an area of 1,648,195 km2  (636,372 sq mi).[31]  Iran lies between latitudes 24°  and 40° N, and longitudes 44°  and 64° E
. Its borders are with Azerbaijan  (611 km or 380 mi, with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan  exclave, 179 km or 111 mi)[155]  and Armenia 
(35 km or 22 mi) to the north-west; the Caspian Sea  to the north; Turkmenistan  (992 km or 616 mi) to the north-east; Pakistan 
(909 km or 565 mi) and Afghanistan  (936 km or 582 mi) to the east; Turkey  (499 km or 310 mi) and Iraq (1,458 km or 906 mi) to
the west; and finally the waters of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman  to the south.

Mount Damavand, Iran's highest point, is located in Amol County, Mazenderan.Iran consists of the Iranian Plateau  with the exception of the coasts of the Caspian Sea and Khuzestan Province. It is one of the
world's most mountainous countries, its landscape dominated by rugged mountain ranges  that separate various basins  or plateaux 
from one another. The populous western part is the most mountainous, with ranges such as the Caucasus, Zagros  and Alborz 
Mountains; the last contains Iran's highest point, Mount Damavand  at 5,610 m (18,406 ft), which is also the highest mountain on
the Eurasian landmass west of the Hindu Kush.[156]

The northern part of Iran is covered by dense rain forests called Shomal  or the Jungles of Iran.[citation needed]  The eastern
part consists mostly of desert  basins such as the Dasht-e Kavir, Iran's largest desert, in the north-central portion of the
country, and the Dasht-e Lut, in the east, as well as some salt lakes. This is because the mountain ranges are too high for rain
clouds to reach these regions.

The only large plains  are found along the coast of the Caspian Sea and at the northern end of the Persian Gulf, where Iran
borders the mouth of the Arvand river. Smaller, discontinuous plains are found along the remaining coast of the Persian Gulf, the 
Strait of Hormuz  and the Gulf of Oman.

Mediterranean climateContinental Mediterranean climateIran's climate  ranges from arid  or semiarid, to subtropical  along the Caspian coast and the northern forests.[157]  On the
northern edge of the country (the Caspian coastal plain) temperatures rarely fall below freezing and the area remains humid for
the rest of the year. Summer temperatures rarely exceed 29 °C (84.2 °F).[158][159]  Annual precipitation is 680 mm (26.8 in) in
the eastern part of the plain and more than 1,700 mm (66.9 in) in the western part. United Nations Resident Coordinator for Iran
Gary Lewis has said that "Water scarcity poses the most severe human security challenge in Iran today".[160]

To the west, settlements in the Zagros  basin experience lower temperatures, severe winters with below zero average daily
temperatures and heavy snowfall. The eastern and central basins are arid, with less than 200 mm (7.9 in) of rain, and have
occasional deserts.[161]  Average summer temperatures rarely exceed 38 °C (100.4 °F).[158]  The coastal plains of the Persian Gulf
and Gulf of Oman  in southern Iran have mild winters, and very humid and hot summers. The annual precipitation ranges from 135 to
355 mm (5.3 to 14.0 in).[158]

FAUNA
See also: Wildlife of IranAsiatic cheetah, a critically endangered species  living only in Iran.The wildlife of Iran is composed
of several animal species, including bears, gazelles, wild pigs, wolves, jackals, panthers, Eurasian lynx, and foxes.[162][163] 
Other domestic animals of Iran include sheep, goats, cattle, horses, water buffaloes, donkeys, and camels. Pheasants, partridges, 
storks, eagles, and falcons  are also native to the wildlife of Iran.

One of the most famous members of the Iranian wildlife is the critically endangered  Asiatic cheetah, also known as the Iranian
cheetah, whose numbers were greatly reduced after the 1979 Revolution.[164]  The Persian leopard, which is the world's largest 
leopard  subspecies living primarily in northern Iran, is also listed as an endangered species.[165]  Iran lost all its Asiatic
lions  and the now extinct Caspian tigers  by the earlier part of the 20th century.[166]

At least 74 species of Iranian wildlife are on the red list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a sign of
serious threats against the country’s biodiversity. The Iranian Parliament  has been showing disregard for wildlife by passing
laws and regulations such as the act that lets the Ministry of Industries and Mines  exploit mines without the involvement of the 
Department of Environment, and by approving large national development projects without demanding comprehensive study of their
impact on wildlife habitats.[167]

The most populated cities of Iran in 2010.Iran is divided into five regions  with thirty one provinces  (ostān),[168]  each governed by an appointed governor (ostāndār).
The provinces are divided into counties (shahrestān), and subdivided into districts (bakhsh) and sub-districts (dehestān).

Iran has one of the highest urban growth rates in the world. From 1950 to 2002, the urban proportion of the population increased
from 27% to 60%.[169]  The United Nations predicts that by 2030, 80% of the population will be urban.[170][not in citation given] 
Most internal migrants have settled near the cities of Tehran, Isfahan, Ahvaz, and Qom. The listed populations are from the
2006/07 (1385AP) census.[171][not in citation given]

Tehran, with a population of around 8.1 million (2011 census), is the capital and largest city in Iran. It is an economical and
cultural center in Iran, and is the hub of the country's communication  and transport  network.

The country's second largest city, Mashhad, has a population of around 2.7 million (2011 census). It is the capital of Razavi
Khorasan Province, and is a holy city in Shia Islam, as it is the site of the Imam Reza Shrine. About 15 to 20 million pilgrims
visit the Shrine of Imam Reza every year.[172][173]

Isfahan, with a population of around 1.7 million (2011 census), is Iran's third largest city and the capital of Isfahan Province.
It was also a former capital of Iran, and contains a wide variety of historical sites; including the famous Image of the World
Square, Siose Bridge, and the sites at the Armenian district of New Jolfa.[174]  It is also home to the 5th largest shopping mall
in the world, namely Isfahan City Center.

The fourth major city of Iran, Karaj, has a population of around 1.6 million (2011 census). It is the capital of Alborz Province,
and is situated 20 km west of Tehran, at the foot of the Alborz  mountains. It is a major industrial city in Iran, with large
factories producing sugar, textiles, wire, and alcohol.

Tabriz, the capital of East Azerbaijan Province, is considered the second industrial city of Iran (after Tehran). With a
population of around 1.4 million (2011 census), it is the fifth major city of Iran, which had been the second-largest until the
late 1960s. It is one of the former capitals of Iran, the first capital of the Safavid Empire, and has also been proven extremely
influential in the country’s recent history.

Shiraz, with a population of around 1.4 million (2011 census), is the sixth major city of Iran. It is the capital of Fars Province
, and was also a former capital of Iran. The area was greatly influenced by the Babylonian  civilization, and after the emergence
of the ancient Persians, soon came to be known as Persis. Persians were present in the region since the 9th century BC, and became
rulers of a large empire under the reign of the Achaemenid Dynasty  in the 6th century BC. The ruins of Persepolis  and Pasargadae
, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire, are located around the modern-day city of Shiraz.

Main article: Politics of IranAli Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping  on January 23,
2016. – Iran and China are strategic allies.[177][178]
Iran's syncretic political system combines elements of a modern Islamic theocracy with democracy.The political system of the
Islamic Republic is based on the 1979 Constitution, and comprises several intricately connected governing bodies. The Leader of
the Revolution  ("Supreme Leader") is responsible for delineation and supervision  of the general policies of the Islamic Republic
of Iran.[179]  The Supreme Leader is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, controls the military intelligence and security
operations, and has sole power to declare war or peace.[179]  The heads of the judiciary, state radio and television networks, the
commanders of the police and military forces and six of the twelve members of the Guardian Council  are appointed by the Supreme
Leader.[179]  The Assembly of Experts  elects and dismisses the Supreme Leader on the basis of qualifications and popular esteem.
[180]

According to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the powers of government in the Islamic Republic of Iran are vested
in the legislature, the judiciary, and the executive powers, functioning under the supervision of the "Absolute Guardianship and
the Leadership  of the Ummah" (ولایت مطلقه امر و امامت امت) that refers to the Supreme Leader of Iran.[181]

After the Supreme Leader, the Constitution defines the President of Iran  as the highest state authority.[179][182]  The President
is elected by universal suffrage  for a term of four years and can only be re-elected for one term.[182][dubious  – discuss] 
Presidential candidates must be approved by the Guardian Council before running, in order to ensure their allegiance to the ideals
of the Islamic Revolution.[183]

The President is responsible for the implementation of the Constitution and for the exercise of executive powers, except for
matters directly related to the Supreme Leader, who has the final say in all matters.[179]  The President appoints and supervises
the Council of Ministers, coordinates government decisions, and selects government policies to be placed before the legislature.
[184]  The current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has fired as well as reinstated Council of Ministers members.[185][186]  Eight
Vice-Presidents serve under the President, as well as a cabinet of twenty-two ministers, who must all be approved by the
legislature.[187]

The legislature of Iran (known as the Islamic Consultative Assembly) is a unicameral  body comprising 290 members elected for
four-year terms.[188]  It drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. All parliamentary
candidates and all legislation from the assembly must be approved by the Guardian Council.[189]

The Guardian Council comprises twelve jurists including six appointed by the Supreme Leader. The others are elected by the 
Iranian
Parliament  from among the jurists nominated by the Head of the Judiciary.[190][191]  The Council interprets the constitution and
may veto Parliament. If a law is deemed incompatible with the constitution or Sharia  (Islamic law), it is referred back to
Parliament for revision.[182]  The Expediency Council  has the authority to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Guardian
Council, and serves as an advisory body to the Supreme Leader, making it one of the most powerful governing bodies in the country.

[192]  Local city councils  are elected by public vote to four-year terms in all cities and villages of Iran.

Iran has adopted the separation of powers  among the servants of the Supreme Leader, having three typical division of branches: 
Executive  (incumbent: Hassan Rouhani), Legislature  (incumbent: Ali Larijani), and the Judiciary  (incumbent: Sadeq Larijani).

LAW
Main article: Judicial system of Iran
The Iranian ParliamentThe Supreme Leader appoints the head of Iran's judiciary, who in turn appoints the head of the Supreme Court
and the chief public prosecutor.[193]  There are several types of courts including public courts that deal with civil and criminal
cases, and revolutionary courts  which deal with certain categories of offenses, including crimes against national security. The
decisions of the revolutionary courts are final and cannot be appealed.[193]

The Special Clerical Court handles crimes allegedly committed by clerics, although it has also taken on cases involving lay people
. The Special Clerical Court functions independently of the regular judicial framework and is accountable only to the Supreme
Leader. The Court's rulings are final and cannot be appealed.[193]  The Assembly of Experts, which meets for one week annually,
comprises 86 "virtuous and learned" clerics elected by adult suffrage for eight-year terms. As with the presidential and
parliamentary elections, the Guardian Council determines candidates' eligibility.[193]  The Assembly elects the Supreme Leader and
has the constitutional authority to remove the Supreme Leader from power at any time.[193]  It has not challenged any of the
Supreme Leader's decisions.[193]  The current head of the judicial system Sadeq Larijani, appointed by long-time Supreme Leader 
Ali Khamenei, said that it is illegal for the Assembly of Experts  to supervise Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.[194]

FOREIGN RELATIONS
Main article: Foreign relations of Iran
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani  meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. – Iran and Russia are strategic allies.[195][196]

[197]The Iranian government's officially stated goal is to establish a new world order  based on world peace, global collective
security  and justice.[198][199]

Often, Iran's foreign relations since the time of the revolution have been portrayed as being based on two strategic principles:
eliminating outside influences in the region and pursuing extensive diplomatic contacts with developing and non-aligned countries.

[200]

Iranian FM M. Javad Zarif  shaking hands with the US Secretary of State John Kerry  during the Iranian nuclear talks. – There is
no formal diplomatic relationship between Iran and the US.Since 2005, Iran's nuclear program  has become the subject of contention with the international community following earlier quotes
of Iranian leadership favoring the use of an atomic bomb against Iran's enemies and in particular Israel.[201]  Many countries
have expressed concern that Iran's nuclear program  could divert civilian nuclear technology into a weapons program. This has led
the UN Security Council  to impose sanctions against Iran  which had further isolated Iran politically and economically from the
rest of the global community. In 2009, the US Director of National Intelligence  said that Iran, if choosing to, would not be able
to develop a nuclear weapon until 2013.[202]

As of 2009[update], Iran maintains diplomatic relations with 99 members of the United Nations,[203]  but not with the United
States or Israel, a state which Iran has not recognized since the 1979 Revolution.[204]

On July 14, 2015, Tehran and the P5+1  came to a historic agreement  to end economic sanctions  after demonstrating a peaceful
nuclear research project that meets International Atomic Energy Agency  standards.[205]

Iran is also a member of dozens of international organizations including the G-15, G-24, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, IDA, IDB, IFC, ILO, IMF
, International Maritime Organization, Interpol, OIC, OPEC,[206]  the United Nations, WHO, and currently has observer status at
the World Trade Organization.

MILITARY
Main article: Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of IranFotros (UCAV)  is considered the largest in Iran's arsenal of unmanned
aerial vehicles. Iran has made several indigenous UAVs.The Islamic Republic of Iran has two types of armed forces: the regular
forces Islamic Republic of Iran Army, Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, Islamic Republic of Iran Navy  and the Revolutionary
Guards, totaling about 545,000 active troops. Iran also has around 350,000 Reserve Force totaling around 900,000 trained troops.
[207]

Iran has a paramilitary, volunteer militia force within the IRGC, called the Basij, which includes about 90,000 full-time,
active-duty uniformed members. Up to 11 million men and women are members of the Basij who could potentially be called up for
service; GlobalSecurity.org estimates Iran could mobilize "up to one million men". This would be among the largest troop
mobilizations in the world.[208]  In 2007, Iran's military spending represented 2.6% of the GDP or $102 per capita, the lowest
figure of the Persian Gulf  nations.[209]  Iran's military doctrine is based on deterrence.[210]  In 2014 arms spending the
country spent $15 billion and was outspent by the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council  by a factor of 13.[211]

Iran supports the military activities of its allies in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon (Hezbollah) with thousands of rockets and
missiles.[212]

Since the 1979 Revolution, to overcome foreign embargoes, Iran has developed its own military industry, produced its own tanks, 
armored personnel carriers, guided missiles, submarines, military vessels, guided missile destroyer, radar  systems, helicopters 
and fighter planes.[213]  In recent years, official announcements have highlighted the development of weapons such as the Hoot, 
Kowsar, Zelzal, Fateh-110, Shahab-3  and Sejjil  missiles, and a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles  (UAVs).[214]  Iran has the
largest and most diverse ballistic missile  arsenal in the Middle East.[215]  The Fajr-3 (MIRV), a liquid fuel  missile with an
undisclosed range which was developed and produced domestically, is currently the most advanced ballistic missile of the country.

ECONOMY
Main article: Economy of IranSee also: Iranian subsidy reform plan, Tehran Stock Exchange, Transport in Iran, and Communications
in IranIran's provinces  by their contribution to national GDP, 2014.Iran's economy  is a mixture  of central planning, state ownership  of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and
small-scale private trading and service ventures.[216]  In 2014, GDP was $404.1 billion ($1.334 trillion at PPP), or $17,100 at 
PPP  per capita.[31]  Iran is ranked as an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank.[217]  In the early 21st century the
service sector contributed the largest percentage of the GDP, followed by industry (mining  and manufacturing) and agriculture.
[218]

The Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran  is responsible for developing and maintaining the Iranian rial, which serves as
the country's currency. The government doesn't recognize trade unions  other than the Islamic Labour Councils, which are subject
to the approval of employers and the security services.[219]  The minimum wage in June 2013 was 487 million rials a month ($134).
[220]  Unemployment has remained above 10% since 1997, and the unemployment rate for women is almost double that of the men.[220]

In 2006, about 45% of the government's budget came from oil and natural gas revenues, and 31% came from taxes and fees.[221]  As
of 2007[update], Iran had earned $70 billion in foreign exchange reserves  mostly (80%) from crude oil exports.[222]  Iranian
budget deficits  have been a chronic problem, mostly due to large-scale state subsidies, that include foodstuffs and especially
gasoline, totaling more than $84 billion in 2008 for the energy sector alone.[223][224]  In 2010, the economic reform plan  was
approved by parliament to cut subsidies  gradually and replace them with targeted social assistance. The objective is to move
towards free market  prices in a 5-year period and increase productivity and social justice.[225]

Tehran  is the economic center of Iran, hosting 45% of the country's industries.[226]The administration continues to follow the market reform plans  of the previous one and indicated that it will diversify Iran's
oil-reliant economy. Iran has also developed a biotechnology, nanotechnology, and pharmaceuticals  industry.[227]  However,
nationalized industries such as the bonyads  have often been managed badly, making them ineffective and uncompetitive with years.
Currently, the government is trying to privatize these industries, and, despite successes, there are still several problems to be
overcome, such as the lagging corruption in the public sector  and lack of competitiveness. In 2010, Iran was ranked 69, out of
139 nations, in the Global Competitiveness Report.[228]

Iran has leading manufacturing industries in the fields of car-manufacture and transportation, construction materials, home
appliances, food and agricultural goods, armaments, pharmaceuticals, information technology, power and petrochemicals in the
Middle East.[229]  According to FAO, Iran has been a top five producer of the following agricultural products in the world in
2012: apricots, cherries, sour cherries, cucumbers  and gherkins, dates, eggplants, figs, pistachios, quinces, walnuts, and 
watermelons.[230]

Economic sanctions against Iran, such as the embargo against Iranian crude oil, have affected the economy.[231]  Sanctions have
led to a steep fall in the value of the rial, and as of April 2013 one US dollar is worth 36,000 rial, compared with 16,000 in
early 2012.[232]  In 2015, Iran and the P5+1  reached a deal on the nuclear program  that removed the main sanctions pertaining to
 Iran's nuclear program  by 2016.[233]

TOURISM
Main article: Tourism in Iran
Over 1 million tourists visit Kish Island  each year.[234]Although tourism declined significantly during the war with Iraq, it has
been subsequently recovered. About 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004, and 2.3 million in 2009, mostly from Asian
countries, including the republics of Central Asia, while about 10% came from the European Union  and North America.[235][236]
[237]  Over five million tourists visited Iran in the fiscal year of 2014–2015, ending March 21, four percent more year-on-year.
[238]

Alongside the capital, the most popular tourist destinations are Isfahan, Mashhad  and Shiraz.[239]  In the early 2000s, the
industry faced serious limitations in infrastructure, communications, industry standards and personnel training.[240]  The
majority of the 300,000 tourist visas  granted in 2003 were obtained by Asian Muslims, who presumably intended to visit important 
pilgrimage  sites in Mashhad  and Qom.[237]  Several organized tours from Germany, France and other European countries come to
Iran annually to visit archaeological sites and monuments. In 2003, Iran ranked 68th in tourism revenues worldwide.[241] 
According to UNESCO  and the deputy head of research for Iran Travel and Tourism Organization (ITTO), Iran is rated 4th among the
top 10 destinations in the Middle East.[241]  Domestic tourism  in Iran is one of the largest in the world.[242][243][244]  Weak
advertising, unstable regional conditions, a poor public image in some parts of the world, and absence of efficient planning
schemes in the tourism sector have all hindered the growth of tourism.

Since the removal of some sanctions against Iran in 2015, tourism has re-surged in the country. Over 5 million tourists visited
Iran in the fiscal year of 2014–2015, four percent more than the previous year.[245]

ENERGY
Main articles: Energy in Iran, Petroleum industry in Iran, Nuclear program of Iran, and Foreign direct investment in Iran
Iran holds 10% of the world's proven oil reserves  and 15% of its gas. It is OPEC's second largest exporter and the world's fourth
oil producer.Iran has the second largest proved gas reserves  in the world after Russia, with 33.6 trillion cubic metres,[246]  and third 
largest natural gas production  in the world after Indonesia, and Russia. It also ranks fourth in oil reserves  with an estimated
153,600,000,000 barrels.[247][248]  It is OPEC's 2nd largest oil exporter and is an energy superpower.[249][250]  In 2005, Iran
spent US$4 billion on fuel imports, because of contraband  and inefficient domestic use.[251]  Oil industry output averaged 4
million barrels per day (640,000 m3/d) in 2005, compared with the peak of six million barrels per day reached in 1974. In the
early years of the 2000s (decade), industry infrastructure was increasingly inefficient because of technological lags. Few
exploratory wells  were drilled in 2005.

In 2004, a large share of natural gas reserves in Iran  were untapped. The addition of new hydroelectric  stations and the
streamlining of conventional coal and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts. Of that amount, about
75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power. In 2004, Iran opened its first wind-powered and
geothermal plants, and the first solar  thermal plant is to come online in 2009. Iran is the third country in the world to have
developed GTL  technology.[252]

Demographic  trends and intensified industrialization have caused electric power  demand to grow by 8% per year. The government’s
goal of 53,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2010 is to be reached by bringing on line new gas-fired plants  and by adding
hydroelectric, and nuclear power generating capacity. Iran’s first nuclear power plant  at Bushehr  went online in 2011. It is the
second Nuclear Power Plant  that ever built in the Middle East after Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant  in Armenia.[253][254]

EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Main articles: Education in Iran  and Science and technology in Iran
An 18th-century Persian astrolabe.Education in Iran  is highly centralized. K-12 education  is supervised by the Ministry of Education, and higher education is
under the supervision of the Ministry of Science and Technology. The adult literacy rated 93.0% in September 2015,[255]  while it
had rated 85.0% in 2008, up from 36.5% in 1976.[256]

The requirement to enter into higher education is to have a high school diploma  and pass the national university entrance
examination, Iranian University Entrance Exam  (known as concour), which is the equivalent of the US SAT  exams. Many students do
a 1–2 year course of pre-university  (piš-dānešgāh), which is the equivalent of GCE  A-levels  and International Baccalaureate.
The completion of the pre-university course earns students the Pre-University Certificate.[257]

Central office of the FUM.Higher education is sanctioned by different levels of diplomas. Kārdāni  (associate degree; also known as fowq e diplom) is
delivered after 2 years of higher education; kāršenāsi  (bachelor's degree; also known as licāns) is delivered after 4 years of
higher education; and kāršenāsi e aršad  (master's degree) is delivered after 2 more years of study, after which another exam
allows the candidate to pursue a doctoral program (PhD; known as doctorā).[258]

According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, the top-ranking universities in the country are the University of
Tehran  (468th worldwide), the Tehran University of Medical Sciences  (612th) and Ferdowsi University of Mashhad  (815th).[259]

Iran has increased its publication output nearly tenfold from 1996 through 2004, and has been ranked first in terms of output
growth rate, followed by China.[260]  According to SCImago, Iran could rank fourth in the world in terms of research output by
2018, if the current trend persists.[261]

runs 96 cores. Its performance was pegged at 192 GFLOPS.[262]  Sorena 2  Robot, which was designed by engineers at the University
of Tehran, was unveiled in 2010. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE) has placed the name of Surena among
the five prominent robots of the world after analyzing its performance.[263]

According to a study by David Morrison and Ali Khadem Hosseini (Harvard-MIT and Cambridge), stem cell  research in Iran is amongst
the top 10 in the world.[266]  Iran ranks 15th in the world in nanotechnologies.[267][268][269]

Iran placed its domestically built satellite, Omid  into orbit on the 30th anniversary of the 1979 Revolution, on 2 February 2009,

[270]  through Safir rocket, becoming the ninth country  in the world capable of both producing a satellite and sending it into 
space  from a domestically made launcher.[271]

The Iranian nuclear program  was launched in the 1950s. Iran is the seventh country to produce uranium hexafluoride, and controls
the entire nuclear fuel cycle.[272][273]

Iranian scientists outside Iran have also made some major contributions to science. In 1960, Ali Javan  co-invented the first gas
laser, and fuzzy set theory  was introduced by Lotfi Zadeh.[274]  Iranian cardiologist, Tofy Mussivand  invented and developed the
first artificial cardiac pump, the precursor of the artificial heart. Furthering research and treatment of diabetes, HbA1c  was
discovered by Samuel Rahbar. Iranian physics is especially strong in string theory, with many papers being published in Iran.[275] 
 Iranian-American  string theorist Kamran Vafa  proposed the Vafa-Witten theorem  together with Edward Witten. In August 2014, 
Maryam Mirzakhani  became the first-ever woman, as well as the first-ever Iranian, to receive the Fields Medal, the highest prize
in mathematics.[276]

75,149,669+1.29%Source: United Nations Demographic Yearbook[277]Iran is a diverse country, consisting of many religious and ethnic
groups that are unified through a shared Iranian language and culture.[278]

Iran's population grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century, increasing from about 19 million in 1956 to around 75
million by 2009.[279][280]  However, Iran's birth rate  has dropped significantly in recent years, leading to a population growth
rate—recorded from July 2012—of about 1.29%.[281]  Studies project that the growth will continue to slow until it stabilizes above
105 million by 2050.[282][283]

Iran hosts one of the largest refugee  populations in the world, with more than one million refugees, mostly from Afghanistan  and
 Iraq.[284]  Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the UNHCR  and Afghan officials for their repatriation.[285] 
According to estimates, about five million Iranian citizens  have emigrated to other countries, mostly since the 1979 Revolution.
[286][287]

According to the Iranian Constitution, the government is required to provide every citizen of the country with access to social
security  that covers retirement, unemployment, old age, disability, accidents, calamities, health and medical treatment and care
services.[288]  This is covered by tax revenues  and income derived from public contributions.[289]

LANGUAGES
Main article: Languages of IranThe majority of the population speak Persian, which is also the official language  of the country. Others include speakers of the
rest of the Iranian languages  within the greater Indo-European languages, and the languages of the other ethnicities in Iran.

In northern Iran, mostly confined to Gilan  and Mazenderan  provinces, the Gilaki  and Mazenderani  languages are widely spoken.
They both have affinities to the neighboring Caucasian languages. In parts of Gilan, the Talysh language  is also widely spoken,
which stretches up to the neighboring country of Azerbaijan. Kurdish  is widely spoken in Kurdistan Province  and nearby areas. In
 Khuzestan, many distinct Persian dialects  are spoken. The Lurish  and Lari  languages are spoken in southwestern and southern
Iran.

The Turkic languages  and dialects, most importantly Azerbaijani Turkish  which is by far the most spoken language in the country
after Persian,[290]  are spoken in different areas in Iran, but are especially widely and dominantly spoken in the provinces of
Azerbaijan.

Notable minority languages in Iran include Armenian, Georgian, Neo-Aramaic, and Arabic. Khuzi Arabic  is spoken by the Arabs in
Khuzestan, and the wider group of Iranian Arabs. Circassian  was also once widely used by the large Circassian minority, but, due
to assimilation over the many years, no sizable number of Circassians speak the language anymore.[291][292][293][294]

Percentages of spoken language continue to be a point of debate, as many opt that they are politically motivated; most notably
regarding the largest and second-largest ethnicities in Iran, the Persians and Azerbaijanis. The following percentages are
according to the CIA's World Factbook: 53% Persian, 16% Azerbaijani Turkish, 10% Kurdish, 7% Mazenderani  and Gilaki, 7% Luri, 2% 
Turkmen, 2% Balochi, 2% Arabic, and 2% the remainder Armenian, Georgian, Neo-Aramaic, and Circassian.[31]

ETHNIC GROUPS
Main article: Ethnicities in IranAs with the spoken languages, the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate, mainly
regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups, the Persians and Azerbaijanis, due to the lack of Iranian state censuses
based on ethnicity. The CIA's World Factbook  has estimated that around 79% of the population of Iran are a diverse Indo-European 
 ethno-linguistic group  that comprise the speakers of the Iranian languages,[295]  with Persians  (incl. Mazenderanis  and Gilaks
) constituting 61% of the population, Kurds  10%, Lurs  6%, and Balochs  2%. Peoples of the other ethno-linguistic groups make up
the remaining 21%, with Azerbaijanis  constituting 16%, Arabs  2%, Turkmens  and Turkic tribes  2%, and others 1% (such as 
Armenians, Talysh, Georgians, Circassians, Assyrians).[296]

The Library of Congress  issued slightly different estimates: Persians 65% (incl. Mazenderanis, Gilaks and Talysh people), 
Azerbaijanis  16%, Kurds  7%, Lurs  6%, Baluchi  2%; Turkic tribal groups such as Qashqai  1%, and Turkmens  1%; and non-Iranian,
non-Turkic groups such as Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Circassians, and Arabs less than 3%. It determined that Persian is the
first language of at least 65% of the country's population, and is the second language for most of the remaining 35%.[297]

Ethnicities and religions in Iran.Other non-governmental  estimations regarding the groups other than the Persians and Azerbaijanis roughly congruate with the World
Factbook and the Library of Congress. However, many scholarly and organisational estimations regarding the number of these two
groups differ significantly from the mentioned census. According to many of them, the number of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran
comprises between 21.6–30% of the total population, with the majority holding it on 25%.c[298]d[299][300][301][302][303]  In any
case, the largest population of Azerbaijanis in the world live in Iran.

RELIGION
Main articles: Religion in Iran  and Irreligion in IranSee also: Islamization of IranHistorically, Proto-Iranian religion  and the subsequent Zoroastrianism  and Manichaeism  were the dominant religions in Iran,
particularly during the Median, Achaemenid, Parthian  and Sassanid  empires. This changed after the fall of the Sassanid Empire by
the Muslim Conquest of Iran. Iran was predominantly Sunni until the conversion of the country (as well as the people of what is
today the neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan) to Shia Islam by the order of the Safavid dynasty  in the 16th century.[103]

Today, the Twelver  Shia Islam is the official state religion, to which about 90% to 95%[304][305]  of the population officially
belong. About 4% to 8% of the population are Sunni Muslims, mainly Kurds  and Balochs. The remaining 2% are non-Muslim religious
minorities, including Christians, Jews, Bahais, Mandeans, Yezidis, Yarsanis, and Zoroastrians.[31][306]

Judaism has a long history in Iran, dating back to the Achaemenid Conquest of Babylonia. Although many left in the wake of the
establishment of the State of Israel and the 1979 Revolution, around 8,756 Jews remain in Iran, according to the latest census.
[307]  Iran has the largest Jewish population in the Middle East outside of Israel.[308]

Around 250,000–370,000 Christians reside in Iran,[309][310]  and it is the largest recognized minority religion in the nation.
Most are of Armenian  background with a sizable minority of Assyrians  as well.[311]

Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and the Sunni branch of Islam are officially recognized by the government, and have
reserved seats in the Iranian Parliament.[123]  But the Bahá'í Faith, which is said to be the largest non-Muslim religious
minority in Iran,[312]  is not officially recognized, and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran since the 19th century.
Since the 1979 Revolution, the persecution of Bahais  has increased with executions, the denial of civil rights and liberties, and
the denial of access to higher education and employment.[313][314][315]

The government has not released statistics regarding irreligiosity. However, the irreligious figures are growing and are higher in
the diaspora, notably among Iranian Americans.[316][317]

CULTURE
Main article: Culture of IranThe earliest recorded cultures within the region of Iran date back to the Lower Paleolithic era.

Owing to its dominant geopolitical position and culture in the world, Iran has directly influenced cultures as far away as Greece,
 Macedonia, and Italy  to the West, Russia to the North, the Arabian Peninsula  to the South, and indirectly South  and East Asia 
to the East.

ART
Main articles: Iranian art  and Persian carpet
Ceiling of the Lotfollah Mosque.
A Safavid painting  kept at the Abbasi Caravanserai  in Isfahan.Iranian works of art show a great variety in style, in different
regions and periods.[318]  Iranian art encompasses many disciplines, including architecture, painting, weaving, pottery, 
calligraphy, metalworking, and stonemasonry. The Median and Achaemenid empires left a significant classical art scene which
remained as basic influences for the art of the later eras. The art of the Parthians was a mixture of Iranian and Hellenistic 
artworks, with their main motifs being scenes of royal hunting expeditions and investitures.[319][320]  The Sassanid art  played a
prominent role in the formation of both European and Asian medieval art,[78]  which carried forward to the Islamic world, and much
of what later became known as Islamic learning, such as philology, literature, jurisprudence, philosophy, medicine, architecture,
and science, were of Sassanid basis.[321][322][323]

There is also a vibrant Iranian modern and contemporary art  scene, with its genesis in the late 1940s. The 1949 Apadana Gallery 
of Tehran, which was operated by Mahmoud Javadi Pour and other colleagues, and the emergence of artists such as Marcos Grigorian 
in the 1950s, signaled a commitment to the creation of a form of modern art grounded in Iran.[324]

Iranian carpet-weaving dates back to the Bronze Age, and is one of the most distinguished manifestations of the art of Iran. Iran
is the world's largest producer and exporter of handmade carpets, producing three quarters of the world's total output and having
a share of 30% of world's export markets.[325][326]

Iran is also home to one of the largest jewel collections  in the world.

ARCHITECTURE
Main articles: Iranian architecture  and Persian gardensThe history of Iranian architecture goes back to the 7th millennium BC.[327]  Iranians were among the first to use mathematics, 
geometry  and astronomy  in architecture.

Iranian architecture displays great variety, both structural and aesthetic, developing gradually and coherently out of earlier
traditions and experience.[328]  The guiding motifs of Iranian architecture are unity, continuity and cosmic symbolism.[329]

Iran ranks seventh among countries with the most archaeological architectural ruins and attractions from antiquity, as recognized
by UNESCO.[330]

LITERATURE
Main article: Persian literature
Mausoleum of Ferdowsi  in Tus.Iranian literature is one of the world's oldest literatures, dating back to the poetry of Avesta and
Zoroastrian literature.

Poetry is used in many Iranian classical works, whether in literature, science, or metaphysics. The Persian language  has been
dubbed as a worthy language to serve as a conduit for poetry, and is considered as one of the four main bodies of world
literature.[331]  Dialects of Persian are sporadically spoken throughout regions from China to Syria and Russia, though mainly in
the Iranian Plateau.[332][333]

Iran has a number of famous poets; most notably Rumi, Ferdowsi, Hafez, Saadi Shirazi, Khayyám Ney-Shapuri, and Nezami Ganjavi.
[334]  Historically, Iranian literature has inspired writers including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph
Waldo Emerson.[84][85][86]

PHILOSOPHY
Main articles: Ancient philosophy § Ancient Iranian philosophy, and Iranian philosophy
Depiction of Farvahar  in Persepolis.Iranian philosophy originates to Indo-Iranian  roots, with Zarathustra's teachings having major influences.

According to the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the
Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states, "Zarathushtra's philosophy entered to influence
Western tradition through Judaism, and therefore on Middle Platonism."

While there are ancient relations between the Indian Vedas  and the Iranian Avesta, the two main families of the Indo-Iranian
philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences, especially in their implications for the human being's
position in society and their view of man's role in the universe.

The Cyrus cylinder, which is known as "the first charter of human rights", is often seen as a reflection of the questions and
thoughts expressed by Zarathustra, and developed in Zoroastrian schools of the Achaemenid Era.[335][336]

The earliest tenets of Zoroastrian schools are part of the extant scriptures of the Zoroastrian religion in the Avestan language.
Among them are treatises such as the Shikand-gumanic Vichar, Denkard, Zātspram, as well as older passages of Avesta, and the 
Gathas.[337]

MYTHOLOGY
Main articles: Iranian mythology  and Iranian folklore
Statue of Arash the Archer  at the Sadabad Complex.Iranian mythology  consists of ancient Iranian folklore  and stories, all involving extraordinary beings. They reflect attitudes
towards the confrontation of good and evil, actions of the gods, and the exploits of heroes and fabulous creatures.

Myths play a crucial part in the culture of Iran, and understanding of them is increased when they are considered within the
context of actual events in the history of Iran. The geography of Greater Iran, a vast area covering the present-day Iran, the
Caucasus, Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Central Asia, with its high mountain ranges, plays the main role in much of the Iranian
mythology.

Shahnameh  of Ferdowsi is the main collection of the mythology of Iran, which draws heavily on the stories and characters of
Zoroastrianism, from the texts of Avesta, Denkard and Bundahishn.

OBSERVANCES
See also: Public holidays in Iran  and Iranian calendarsHaft-Seen  (or Haft-Čin), a customary of the Iranian New Year.Iran has
three official calendar systems, including the Solar calendar  as the main, the Gregorian calendar  for international and
Christian events, and the Lunar calendar  for Islamic events.

The main national annual of Iran is Nowruz, an ancient tradition celebrated on 21 March to mark the beginning of spring and the 
New Year  of Iran. It is enjoyed by people with different religions, but is a holiday for Zoroastrians. It was registered on the
list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity,[338]  and was described as the Persian New Year[339][340]
[341][342]  by UNESCO in 2009.

Other remained national annuals of Iran include:

 * Čā'r Šanbe Suri: A prelude to Nowruz, in honor of Ātar  (the Holy Fire), celebrated by fireworks and fire-jumping, on the last
   Wednesday eve of the year.
 * Sizde be Dar: Leaving the house to join the nature, on the thirteenth day of the New Year (April 2).
 * Čelle ye Zemestān: Also known as Yaldā; the longest night of the year, celebrated on the eve of Winter Solstice, by reciting
   poetry and having the customary fruits which include watermelon, pomegranate  and mixed nuts.
 * Tirgān: A mid summer festival, in honor of Tishtrya, celebrated on Tir  13 (July 4), by splashing water, reciting poetry and
   having traditional dishes such as šole-zard and spinach soup.
 * Mehrgān: An autumn festival, in honor of Mithra, celebrated on Mehr  16 (October 8), by family gathering and setting a table of
   sweets, flowers and a mirror.
 * Sepand Ārmazgān: Dedicated to Ameša Spenta  (the Holy Devotion); celebrated by giving presents to partners, on Esfand  15
   (February 24).

Along with the national celebrations, annuals such as Ramezān, Eid e Fetr, and Ruz e Āšurā  are marked by Muslims; Noel, Čelle ye
Ruze, and Eid e Pāk  are celebrated by Christians; and the festivals Purim, Eid e Fatir, and Tu Bišvāt  are celebrated by Jewish
people in Iran.

MUSIC
Main article: Music of IranKarna, an ancient Iranian musical instrument from the 6th century BC.Iran is the apparent birthplace of
the earliest complex instruments, as evidenced by the archaeological records found in Western Iran, dating back to the 3rd
millennium BC.[343]  The Iranian use of both vertical and horizontal angular harps  have been documented at the sites Madaktu and 
Kul-e Farah, with the largest collection of Elamite  instruments documented at Kul-e Farah. Multiple depictions of horizontal
harps were also sculpted in Assyrian palaces, dating back between 865 and 650 BC.

Xenophon's Cyropaedia  refers to a great number of singing women at the court of the Achaemenid Iran. Athenaeus of Naucratis 
states that, by the time of the last Achaemenid king, Artashata  (336–330 BC), Achaemenid singing girls were captured by the 
Macedonian  general, Parmenion.[344]  Under the Parthian Empire, a type of epic music was taught to youth, depicting the national
epics and myths which were later represented in the Shahnameh  of Ferdowsi.[345]

History of the Sassanid music  is better documented than the earlier periods, and is specially more evident in the Zoroastrian 
contexts.[346]  By the time of Khosrow II, the Sassanid royal court was the host of prominent musicians, namely Ramtin, Bamshad, 
Nakisa, Azad, Sarkash, and Barbad.

The National Orchestra of Iran, conducted by Khaleghi  in the 1940s.The first national music society of the modern-day Iran was
founded by Rouhollah Khaleghi in the 1940s, with the School of National Music  established in 1949.[347]  Today, the main
orchestra of Iran include the National Orchestra, the Nations Orchestra, and the Symphony Orchestra of Tehran.

Iranian pop music  emerged by the Qajar Era.[348]  It was led to major developments in the 1950s, by the emergence of stars such
as Viguen, who was referred to as the king of Persian pop and jazz.[349]  The 1970s is known as a "Golden Age" for Iranian pop
music, where a revolution was formed in the music industry of Iran, using indigenous instruments and forms and adding electric
guitar. Hayedeh, Faramarz Aslani, Farhad Mehrad, Googoosh, and Ebi  are among the leading artists of this period.

The emergence of genres such as modern rock  in the 1970s and hip hop  in the 1980s, which replaced the outdated musical styles
among the youth, followed major movements and influences in the music of Iran.[350][351][352][353]

THEATER
Main articles: Persian theater  and Persian danceTheater background of Iran dates back to antiquity. The earliest recorded representations of dancing figures within Iran were
found in prehistoric sites such as Tepe Sialk and Tepe Mūsīān.[354]

The oldest initiation of theater and phenomena of acting among the people of Iran can be traced in the epic ceremonial theaters,
such as Soug e Sivash  and Mogh Koshi  (Megakhouni), and also dances and theater narrations of Iranian mythological tales reported
by Herodotos  and Xenophon.

There are several theatrical genres which emerged before the advent of cinema in Iran, including Xeyme Shab Bazi  (Puppetry), Saye
Bazi  (Shadow play), Ru-howzi  (Comical plays), and Tazieh  (Sorrow plays).

The Roudaki Hall, Tehran.Before the 1979 Revolution, the Iranian national stage had become a famous performing scene for known
international artists and troupes,[355]  with the Roudaki Hall  of Tehran constructed to function as the national stage for opera 
and ballet. Opened on October 26, 1967, the hall is home to the Symphony Orchestra of Tehran, the Opera Orchestra of Tehran, and
the Iranian National Ballet Company, and continues now with Vahdat Hall  as its official name.

The opera Rostam o Sohrab, based on the epic of Rostam and Sohrab  from Shahnameh, is an example of opera performances in the
modern-day Iran.

CINEMA AND ANIMATION
Main articles: Cinema of Iran  and History of Iranian animationThe earliest examples of visual representations in Iranian history
are traced back to the bas-reliefs  of Persepolis, c. 500 BC. Persepolis was the ritual center of the ancient kingdom of 
Achaemenids, and the figures at Persepolis remain bound by the rules of grammar and syntax of visual language.[356]  The Iranian
visual arts reached a pinnacle by the Sassanid Era. A bas-relief from this period in Taq Bostan depicts a complex hunting scene.
Similar works from the period have been found to articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner. It is even
possible to see a progenitor of the cinema close-up in one of these works of art, which shows a wounded wild pig escaping from the
hunting ground.[357]

By the early 20th century, the five-year-old modern industry of cinema came to Iran. The first Iranian filmmaker was Mirza
Ebrahim
Khan (Akkas Bashi), the official photographer of Mozaffar od Din Shah  of Qajar. He obtained a camera and filmed the Shah's visit
to Europe.

In 1904, Mirza Ebrahim Khan (Sahhaf Bashi)  opened the first movie theater in Tehran.[358]  After him, several others like Russi
Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were around 15
cinema theaters in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.[357]

The first silent Iranian film was made by Professor Ovanes Ohanian  in 1930, and the first sounded one, Lor Girl, was made by Abd
ol Hossein Sepanta  in 1932.

Behrouz Vossoughi, a well-known Iranian actor who has appeared in over 90 films.The 1960s was a significant decade for Iranian
cinema, with 25 commercial films produced annually on average throughout the early 60s, increasing to 65 by the end of the decade.
The majority of production focused on melodrama and thrillers. With the screening of the films Kaiser  and The Cow, directed by 
Masoud Kimiai  and Dariush Mehrjui  respectively in 1969, alternative films set out to establish their status in the film industry
and Bahram Beyzai's Downpour  and Nasser Taghvai's Tranquility in the Presence of Others  followed soon. Attempts to organize a
film festival that had begun in 1954 within the framework of the Golrizan Festival, bore fruits in the form of the Sepas Festival
in 1969. The endeavors also resulted in the formation of the Tehran World Festival in 1973.[359]

Abbas Kiarostami  was an admired Iranian film director.After the Revolution of 1979, as the new government imposed new laws and
standards, a new age in Iranian cinema emerged, starting with Viva...  by Khosrow Sinai  and followed by many other directors,
such as Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi. Kiarostami, an admired Iranian director, planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema
when he won the Palme d'Or  for Taste of Cherry  in 1997.[360]  The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious
international festivals, such as the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Berlin International Film Festival,
attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces.[361]  In 2006, six Iranian films, of six different styles, represented Iranian
cinema at the Berlin International Film Festival. Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema.
[362][363]

Asghar Farhadi, a well-known Iranian director, has received a Golden Globe Award  and an Academy Award  for Best Foreign Language
Film, and was named as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the world by Time Magazine  in 2012.

Reproduction of the world's oldest example of animation, dating back to the late half of the 3rd millennium BC, found in Burnt
City, IranThe oldest records of animation in Iran date back to the late 3rd millennium BC. An earthen goblet discovered at the
site of the 5,200-year-old Burnt City in southeastern Iran, depicts what could possibly be the world’s oldest example of
animation. The artifact bears five sequential images depicting a Persian ibex  jumping up to eat the leaves of a tree.[364][365]

The art of animation, as practiced in modern Iran, started in the 1950s. After four decades of Iranian animation production and
three-decade experience of Kanoon Institute, the Tehran International Animation Festival (TIAF) was established in February 1999.
Every two years, participants from more than 70 countries attend this event in Tehran, which holds Iran's biggest national
animation market.[366][367]

MEDIA
Main article: Media of IranIran's telecommunications are handled by the state-owned Telecommunication Company of Iran. Almost all of the media outlets in
Iran are state-owned or subject to authority monitoring. Outlets such as books, movies and music albums must be approved by the 
Ministry of Ershad  before being released to the public.

Most of the newspapers published in Iran  are in Persian. The most widely circulated periodicals of the country are based in
Tehran. Iran's widespread daily and weekly newspapers include Ettela'at, Kayhan, Hamshahri  and Resalat.[243]  Tehran Times, Iran
Daily, and Financial Tribune  are among the English language newspapers based in Iran.

Television was introduced to Iran in 1958.[368]  Although the 1974 Asian Games  was broadcast in color, full color programming
began in 1978.[368]  Since the 1979 Revolution, Iran's largest media corporation is the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting 
(IRIB).[243]  Over 30 percent of Iranians watch satellite channels, but observers state that the figures are likely to be higher.
[369]

Iran received access to the Internet in 1993. According to 2014 census, around 40% of the population of Iran are Internet users.
[370]  Iran ranks 24th among countries by number of Internet users. According to the statistics provided by the web information
company of Alexa, Google Search  and Yahoo!  are the most used search engines in Iran.[371]  Over 80% of the users of Telegram, a 
cloud-based instant messaging  service, are from Iran.[372]  Instagram  is the most popular online social networking service  in
Iran.[371]  Direct access to Facebook  has been blocked in Iran since the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, due to
organization of the opposition movements on the website;[373]  but however, Facebook has around 12 to 17 million users in Iran who
are using virtual private networks  and proxy servers  to access the website.[374]  Around 90% of Iran's e-commerce  takes place
on the Iranian online store of Digikala, which has around 750,000 visitors per day and more than 2.3 million subscribers.[375] 
Digikala is the most visited online store in the Middle East, and ranks 4th among the most visited websites in Iran.[371]

SPORTS
Main article: Sport in Iran
The Azadi Stadium, Tehran.With two thirds of the population under the age of 25, many sports are played in Iran, both traditional
and modern.

Iran is most likely the birthplace of polo,[376][377]  which is locally known as čowgān, with its earliest records attributed to
the ancient Medes.[378]

Freestyle wrestling  has been traditionally regarded as the national sport  of Iran, and the national wrestlers  have been Olympic
and world champions on many occasions. Iran's traditional wrestling called košti e pahlevāni  ("the heroic wrestling") is
registered on the UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage  list.

Weightlifter Kianoush Rostami  wins gold at the 2016 Summer Olympics.Iran's National Olympic Committee  was founded in 1947. Wrestlers and weightlifters  have achieved the country's highest records
at the Olympics.

Soccer  has been regarded as the most popular sport in Iran, with the men's national team  having won the Asian Cup  on three
occasions. The national team has maintained its position as the best Asian squad, as it ranks 1st in Asia and 39th in the world
according to the FIFA World Rankings  (as of August 2016[update]).[379]

Volleyball is the second most popular sport in Iran.[380][381]  The men's national team  is currently the strongest team in Asia,
having won the 2011 and 2013 Asian Men's Volleyball Championships, and rank 8th in the FIVB World Rankings  (as of July 2016).

Basketball  is also popular, with the men's national team  having won three Asian Championships  since 2007.[382]

Skiers at the Dizin Ski Resort.Being a mountainous country, Iran is a venue for skiing, snowboarding, hiking, rock climbing,[383]  and mountain climbing.[384]
[385]

Iran is home to several ski resorts, the most famous being Tochal, Dizin  and Shemshak  which are all within one to three hours
traveling from the capital city Tehran.[386]  The resort of Tochal, located in the Alborz  mountain rage, is the world's
fifth-highest ski resort (3,730 m or 12,238 ft at its highest station). Potentially suitable terrain can also be found in Lorestan
, Mazenderan  and other provinces.

In September 1974, Iran became the first country in West Asia to host the Asian Games. The Azadi Sport Complex, which is the
largest sport complex in Iran, was originally built for this occasion.

In 2016, Iran made global headlines for international female champions boycotting tournaments in Iran in chess (U.S. Woman
Grandmaster Nazi Paikidze)[387][388]  and in shooting (Indian world champion Heena Sidhu)[389]  because they refused to enter a
country where they would be forced to wear a hijab  to compete in their sports.

CUISINE
Main article: Iranian cuisineKuku  Sabzi  with herbs, topped with barberries  and walnutsIranian cuisine is diverse due to its
variety of ethnic groups and the influence of other cultures. Herbs are frequently used along with fruits such as plums,
pomegranates, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins. Iranians usually eat plain yogurt  with lunch and dinner; it is a staple of
the diet in Iran. To achieve a balanced taste, characteristic flavourings such as saffron, dried limes, cinnamon, and parsley are
mixed delicately and used in some special dishes. Onions and garlic are normally used in the preparation of the accompanying
course, but are also served separately during meals, either in raw or pickled form. Iran is also famous for its caviar.[390]

NOTES
 1. ^  In the Avesta the airiia-  are members of the ethnic group of the Avesta-reciters themselves, in contradistinction to the 
    anairiia-, the "non-Aryas". The word also appears four times in Old Persian: One is in the Behistun inscription, where ariya- 
    is the name of a language or script (DB 4.89). The other three instances occur in Darius I's inscription at Naqsh-e Rustam 
    (DNa 14-15), in Darius I's inscription at Susa (DSe 13-14), and in the inscription of Xerxes I  at Persepolis  (XPh 12-13). In
    these, the two Achaemenid dynasts describe themselves as pārsa pārsahyā puça ariya ariyaciça  "a Persian, son of a Persian, an
    Ariya, of Ariya origin." "The phrase with ciça, “origin, descendance”, assures that it [i.e. ariya] is an ethnic name wider in
    meaning than pārsa  and not a simple adjectival epithet".[37]

      "The number of Azeris in Iran is heavily disputed. In 2005, Amanolahi estimated all Turkic-speaking communities in Iran to
      number no more than 9 million. CIA and Library of congress estimates range from 16 percent to 24 percent – that is, 12–18
      million people if we employ the latest total figure for Iran's population (77.8 million). Azeri ethnicsts, on the other
      hand, argue that overall number is much higher, even as much as 50 percent or more of the total population. Such inflated
      estimates may have influenced some Western scholars who suggest that up to 30 percent (that is, some 23 million today)
      Iranians are Azeris." [1]

A 16-point compass rose  with east highlighted.East  is one of the four cardinal directions  or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from west.



ETYMOLOGY
The word east  comes from Middle English  est, from Old English  ēast, which itself comes from the Proto-Germanic  *aus-to-  or *
austra-  "east, toward the sunrise", from Proto-Indo-European  *aus- "to shine," or "dawn".[1]  This is similar to Old High German 
 *ōstar  "to the east", Latin  aurora  "dawn", and Greek  ēōs  or heōs.[2]  Ēostre, a Germanic goddess  of dawn, might have been a
personification of both dawn and the cardinal points.

NAVIGATION
By convention, the right hand side of a map  is east. This convention has developed from the use of a compass, which places north
at the top.

To go east using a compass for navigation, one sets a bearing  or azimuth  of 90°.

CULTURAL
East is the direction toward which the Earth  rotates about its axis, and therefore the general direction from which the Sun 
appears to rise. The practice of praying towards the East is older than Christianity, but has been adopted by this religion as the
Orient was thought of as containing mankind's original home. Hence, some Christian churches have been traditionally oriented
towards the east.[3][4]

Modern humans  (Homo sapiens, primarily ssp.  Homo sapiens sapiens) are the only extant members of Hominina  clade  (or human
clade), a branch  of the taxonomical tribe  Hominini  belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect
posture  and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity  and increased tool  use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward
larger, more complex brains  and societies.[3][4]

Early hominins—particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human
apes—are less often referred to as "human" than hominins of the genus Homo.[5]  Several of these hominins used fire, occupied
much
of Eurasia, and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens  in Africa  about 200,000 years ago.[6][7]  They began to exhibit
evidence of behavioral modernity  around 50,000 years ago. In several waves of migration, anatomically modern humans ventured out
of Africa  and populated most of the world.[8]

The spread of humans and their large and increasing population  has had a profound impact  on large areas of the environment and
millions of native species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain  with a
particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex  and temporal lobes, which enable high levels of abstract reasoning, 
language, problem solving, sociality, and culture  through social learning. Humans use tools  to a much higher degree than any
other animal, are the only extant species known to build fires  and cook their food, and are the only extant species to clothe 
themselves and create and use numerous other technologies  and arts.

Humans are uniquely adept at utilizing systems of symbolic communication (such as language and art) for self-expression and the
exchange of ideas, and for organizing themselves into purposeful groups. Humans create complex social structures  composed of many
cooperating and competing groups, from families  and kinship  networks to political states. Social interactions  between humans
have established an extremely wide variety of values,[9]  social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human
society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena (or
events) has provided the foundation for developing science, philosophy, mythology, religion, anthropology, and numerous other
fields of knowledge.

Though most of human existence has been sustained by hunting and gathering  in band societies,[10]  increasing numbers of human
societies began to practice sedentary  agriculture  approximately some 10,000 years ago,[11]  domesticating plants and animals,
thus allowing for the growth of civilization. These human societies subsequently expanded in size, establishing various forms of
government, religion, and culture around the world, unifying people within regions to form states  and empires. The rapid
advancement of scientific and medical understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the development of fuel-driven
technologies and increased lifespans, causing the human population to rise exponentially. By February 2016, the global human 
population  had exceeded 7.3 billion.[12]

usage, the word "human" generally refers to the only extant species of the genus Homo — anatomically and behaviorally modern Homo
sapiens.

In scientific terms, the meanings of "hominid" and "hominin" have changed during the recent decades with advances in the discovery
and study of the fossil ancestors of modern humans. The previously clear boundary between humans and apes has blurred, resulting
in now acknowledging the hominids as encompassing multiple species, and Homo  and close relatives since the split from chimpanzees
as the only hominins. There is also a distinction between anatomically modern humans  and Archaic Homo sapiens, the earliest
fossil members of the species.

The English adjective human  is a Middle English  loanword  from Old French  humain, ultimately from Latin  hūmānus, the adjective
form of homō  "man." The word's use as a noun (with a plural: humans) dates to the 16th century.[13]  The native English term man 
can refer to the species generally (a synonym for humanity), and could formerly refer to specific individuals of either sex,
though this latter use is now obsolete.[14]

The species binomial  Homo sapiens  was coined by Carl Linnaeus  in his 18th century work Systema Naturae.[15]  The generic name  
Homo  is a learned 18th century derivation from Latin homō  "man," ultimately "earthly being" (Old Latin  hemō  a cognate  to Old
English guma  "man," from PIE  dʰǵʰemon-, meaning "earth" or "ground").[16]  The species-name sapiens  means "wise" or "sapient."
Note that the Latin word homo  refers to humans of either gender, and that sapiens  is the singular form (while there is no such
word as sapien).[17]

HISTORY
EVOLUTION AND RANGE
Main article: Human evolutionFurther information: Anthropology, Homo (genus), and Timeline of human evolutionThe genus Homo  evolved and diverged from other hominins  in Africa, after the human clade split from the chimpanzee  lineage of
the hominids  (great apes) branch of the primates. Modern humans, defined as the species Homo sapiens  or specifically to the
single extant subspecies  Homo sapiens sapiens, proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in Eurasia 
125,000–60,000 years ago,[18][19]  Australia  around 40,000 years ago, the Americas  around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands
such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand  between the years 300 and 1280.[20][21]

EVIDENCE FROM MOLECULAR BIOLOGY


The closest living relatives of humans are chimpanzees (genus Pan) and gorillas (genus Gorilla).[22]  With the sequencing  of both
the human and chimpanzee genome, current estimates of similarity between human and chimpanzee DNA sequences  range between 95% and
99%.[22][23][24]  By using the technique called a molecular clock  which estimates the time required for the number of divergent
mutations to accumulate between two lineages, the approximate date for the split between lineages can be calculated. The gibbons (

Hylobatidae) and orangutans  (genus Pongo) were the first groups to split from the line  leading to the humans, then gorillas 
(genus Gorilla) followed by the chimpanzees  (genus Pan). The splitting date between human and chimpanzee lineages is placed
around 4–8 million years ago during the late Miocene  epoch.[25][26]  During this split, chromosome 2  was formed from two other
chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes.[27][28]

EVIDENCE FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD
There is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla, chimpanzee and hominin lineages.[29][30]  The earliest fossils
that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are Sahelanthropus tchadensis  dating from 7  million years ago, 
Orrorin
tugenensis  dating from 5.7  million years ago, and Ardipithecus kadabba  dating to 5.6  million years ago. Each of these species
has been argued to be a bipedal  ancestor of later hominins, but all such claims are contested. It is also possible that any one
of the three is an ancestor of another branch of African apes, or is an ancestor shared between hominins and other African
Hominoidea (apes). The question of the relation between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be
resolved. From these early species the australopithecines  arose around 4  million years ago  diverged into robust  (also called 
Paranthropus) and gracile  branches, possibly one of which (such as A. garhi, dating to 2.5  million years ago) is a direct
ancestor of the genus Homo.[citation needed]

The earliest members of the genus Homo  are Homo habilis  which evolved around 2.8  million years ago.[31]  Homo habilis  has been
considered the first species for which there is clear evidence of the use of stone tools. More recently, however, in 2015, stone
tools, perhaps predating Homo habilis, have been discovered in northwestern Kenya  that have been dated to 3.3 million years old.
[32]  Nonetheless, the brains of Homo habilis  were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was
bipedalism as an adaptation to terrestrial living. During the next million years a process of encephalization  began, and with the
arrival of Homo erectus  in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. Homo erectus  were the first of the hominina to leave
Africa, and these species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe between 1.3 to 1.8  million years ago. One population of H.
erectus, also sometimes classified as a separate species Homo ergaster, stayed in Africa and evolved into Homo sapiens. It is
believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools. The earliest transitional fossils between H.
ergaster/erectus  and archaic humans  are from Africa such as Homo rhodesiensis, but seemingly transitional forms are also found
at Dmanisi, Georgia. These descendants of African H. erectus  spread through Eurasia from ca. 500,000 years ago evolving into H.
antecessor, H. heidelbergensis  and H. neanderthalensis. The earliest fossils of anatomically modern humans  are from the Middle
Paleolithic, about 200,000 years ago such as the Omo remains  of Ethiopia and the fossils of Herto sometimes classified as Homo
sapiens idaltu.[33]  Later fossils of archaic Homo sapiens  from Skhul  in Israel and Southern Europe begin around 90,000 years
ago.[34]

ANATOMICAL ADAPTATIONS
Reconstruction of Australopithecus afarensis.Reconstruction of Homo habilis, the earliest known species of the genus Homo  and the
first human ancestor to use stone toolsReconstruction of Homo erectusReconstruction of an adult female Homo erectus.Human
evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioral  changes that have taken
place since the split between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The most significant of these adaptations are 1.
bipedalism, 2. increased brain size, 3. lengthened ontogeny  (gestation and infancy), 4. decreased sexual dimorphism  (neoteny).
The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.[35]  Other significant morphological changes included
the evolution of a power and precision grip, a change first occurring in H. erectus.[36]

Bipedalism  is the basic adaption of the hominin line, and it is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes 
shared by all bipedal hominins. The earliest bipedal hominin  is considered to be either Sahelanthropus[37]  or Orrorin, with 
Ardipithecus, a full bipedal, coming somewhat later.[citation needed]  The knuckle walkers, the gorilla  and chimpanzee, diverged
around the same time, and either Sahelanthropus  or Orrorin  may be humans' last shared ancestor with those animals.[citation
needed]  The early bipedals eventually evolved into the australopithecines  and later the genus Homo.[citation needed]  There are
several theories of the adaptational value of bipedalism. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed up the hands
for reaching and carrying food, because it saved energy during locomotion, because it enabled long distance running and hunting,
or as a strategy for avoiding hyperthermia by reducing the surface exposed to direct sun.[citation needed]

The human species developed a much larger brain than that of other primates – typically 1,330 cm3  in modern humans, over twice
the size of that of a chimpanzee or gorilla.[38]  The pattern of encephalization  started with Homo habilis  which at
approximately 600 cm3  had a brain slightly larger than chimpanzees, and continued with Homo erectus  (800–1100 cm3), and reached
a maximum in Neanderthals with an average size of 1200–1900 cm3, larger even than Homo sapiens  (but less encephalized).[39]  The
pattern of human postnatal brain growth  differs from that of other apes (heterochrony), and allows for extended periods of 
social
learning  and language acquisition  in juvenile humans. However, the differences between the structure of human brains  and those
of other apes may be even more significant than differences in size.[40][41][42][43]  The increase in volume over time has
affected different areas within the brain unequally – the temporal lobes, which contain centers for language processing have
increased disproportionately, as has the prefrontal cortex  which has been related to complex decision making and moderating
social behavior.[38]  Encephalization has been tied to an increasing emphasis on meat in the diet,[44][45]  or with the
development of cooking,[46]  and it has been proposed [47]  that intelligence increased as a response to an increased necessity
for solving social problems  as human society became more complex.

The reduced degree of sexual dimorphism is primarily visible in the reduction of the male canine tooth  relative to other ape
species (except gibbons). Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of hidden estrus
. Humans are the only ape in which the female is fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by
the body (such as genital swelling  during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of
body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together
have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on pair bonding  as a possible solution to the requirement for
increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.[citation needed]

RISE OF HOMO SAPIENS
Further information: Recent African origin of modern humans, Multiregional origin of modern humans, Anatomically modern humans, 
Archaic human admixture with modern humans, and Early human migrations
World map of early human migrations according to mitochondrial  population genetics  (numbers are millennia  before present, the
North Pole is at the center).By the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic  period (50,000 BP), full behavioral modernity, including language, music  and other 
cultural universals  had developed.[48][49]  As modern humans spread out from Africa they encountered other hominids such as Homo
neanderthalensis  and the so-called Denisovans. The nature of interaction between early humans and these sister species has been a
long-standing source of controversy, the question being whether humans replaced these earlier species or whether they were in fact
similar enough to interbreed, in which case these earlier populations may have contributed genetic material to modern humans.[50] 
Recent studies of the human and Neanderthal genomes suggest gene flow  between archaic Homo sapiens  and Neanderthals and
Denisovans.[51][52][53]  In March 2016, studies were published that suggest that modern humans bred with hominins, including
Denisovans and Neanderthals, on multiple occasions.[54]

This dispersal out of Africa  is estimated to have begun about 70,000 years BP from Northeast Africa. Current evidence suggests
that there was only one such dispersal and that it only involved a few hundred individuals. The vast majority of humans stayed in
Africa and adapted to a diverse array of environments.[55]  Modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing earlier hominins
(either through competition or hybridization). They inhabited Eurasia  and Oceania  by 40,000 years BP, and the Americas  at least
14,500 years BP.[56][57]

TRANSITION TO CIVILIZATION
Main articles: Neolithic Revolution  and Cradle of civilizationFurther information: History of the world
The rise of agriculture, and domestication  of animals, led to stable human settlements.Until about 10,000 years ago, humans lived
as hunter-gatherers. They gradually gained domination over much of the natural environment. They generally lived in small nomadic
groups known as band societies, often in caves. The advent of agriculture  prompted the Neolithic Revolution, when access to food
surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements, the domestication  of animals and the use of metal tools  for the
first time in history. Agriculture encouraged trade  and cooperation, and led to complex society.[citation needed]

The early civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, Maya, Greece  and Rome  were some of the cradles of civilization.[58]

[59][60]  The Late Middle Ages  and the Early Modern Period  saw the rise of revolutionary ideas and technologies. Over the next
500 years, exploration  and European colonialism  brought great parts of the world under European control, leading to later
struggles for independence. The concept of the modern world as distinct from an ancient world is based on a rapid change progress
in a brief period of time in many areas.[citation needed]  Advances in all areas of human activity prompted new theories such as 
evolution  and psychoanalysis, which changed humanity's views of itself.[citation needed]  The Scientific Revolution, 
Technological Revolution  and the Industrial Revolution  up until the 19th century resulted in independent discoveries such as 
imaging technology, major innovations in transport, such as the airplane and automobile; energy development, such as coal and
electricity.[61]  This correlates with population growth  (especially in America)[62]  and higher life expectancy, the World
population  rapidly increased numerous times in the 19th and 20th centuries as nearly 10% of the 100 billion people lived in the
past century.[63]

With the advent of the Information Age  at the end of the 20th century, modern humans live in a world that has become increasingly
 globalized  and interconnected. As of 2010, almost 2 billion humans are able to communicate with each other via the Internet,[64] 
 and 3.3 billion by mobile phone  subscriptions.[65]  Although interconnection between humans has encouraged the growth of science
, art, discussion, and technology, it has also led to culture clashes  and the development and use of weapons of mass destruction.
[citation needed]  Human civilization has led to environmental destruction  and pollution  significantly contributing to the
ongoing mass extinction  of other forms of life called the Holocene extinction event,[66]  which may be further accelerated by 
global warming  in the future.[67]

HABITAT AND POPULATION
Further information: Human migration, Demography, and World population
The Earth, as seen from space  in October 2000, showing the extent of human occupation of the planet. The bright lights signify
both the most densely inhabited areas and ones financially capable of illuminating those areas.Early human settlements were
dependent on proximity to water  and, depending on the lifestyle, other natural resources  used for subsistence, such as
populations of animal prey for hunting  and arable land  for growing crops and grazing livestock. But humans have a great capacity
for altering their habitats  by means of technology, through irrigation, urban planning, construction, transport, manufacturing 
goods, deforestation  and desertification. Deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of increasing material 
wealth, increasing thermal comfort, improving the amount of food available, improving aesthetics, or improving ease of access to
resources or other human settlements. With the advent of large-scale trade and transport infrastructure, proximity to these
resources has become unnecessary, and in many places, these factors are no longer a driving force behind the growth and decline of
a population. Nonetheless, the manner in which a habitat is altered is often a major determinant in population change.[citation
needed]

Technology has allowed humans to colonize all of the continents and adapt to virtually all climates. Within the last century,
humans have explored Antarctica, the ocean depths, and outer space, although large-scale colonization of these environments is not
yet feasible. With a population of over seven billion, humans are among the most numerous of the large mammals. Most humans (61%)
live in Asia. The remainder live in the Americas  (14%), Africa  (14%), Europe  (11%), and Oceania  (0.5%).[68]

Human habitation within closed ecological systems  in hostile environments, such as Antarctica and outer space, is expensive,
typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions. Life in space has been very
sporadic, with no more than thirteen humans in space at any given time.[69]  Between 1969 and 1972, two humans at a time spent
brief intervals on the Moon. As of November 2016, no other celestial body has been visited by humans, although there has been a
continuous human presence in space since the launch of the initial crew to inhabit the International Space Station  on October 31,
2000.[70]  However, other celestial bodies have been visited by human-made objects.[71][72][73]

Since 1800, the human population  has increased from one billion[74]  to over seven billion,[75]  In 2004, some 2.5 billion out of
6.3 billion people (39.7%) lived in urban areas. In February 2008, the U.N. estimated that half the world's population would live
in urban areas  by the end of the year.[76]  Problems for humans living in cities  include various forms of pollution and crime,
[77]  especially in inner city and suburban slums. Both overall population numbers and the proportion residing in cities are
expected to increase significantly in the coming decades.[78]

Humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment. Humans are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.[79] 
Currently, through land development, combustion of fossil fuels, and pollution, humans are thought to be the main contributor to
global climate change.[80]  If this continues at its current rate it is predicted that climate change will wipe out half of all
plant and animal species over the next century.[81][82]

AND PHYSIOLOGY
Main article: Human bodyFurther information: Human physical appearance, Anatomically modern human, and Sex differences in humans
Most aspects of human physiology are closely homologous  to corresponding aspects of animal  physiology. The human body consists
of the legs, the torso, the arms, the neck, and the head. An adult  human body  consists of about 100 trillion (1014) cells. The
most commonly defined body systems  in humans are the nervous, the cardiovascular, the circulatory, the digestive, the endocrine,
the immune, the integumentary, the lymphatic, the muscoskeletal, the reproductive, the respiratory, and the urinary system.[83]
[84]

Humans, like most of the other apes, lack external tails, have several blood type  systems, have opposable thumbs, and are 
sexually dimorphic. The comparatively minor anatomical differences between humans and chimpanzees  are a result of human 
bipedalism. One difference is that humans have a far faster and more accurate throw  than other animals. Humans are also among the
best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom, but slower over short distances.[85][86]  Humans' thinner body hair and more
productive sweat glands  help avoid heat exhaustion  while running for long distances.[87]

As a consequence of bipedalism, human females have narrower birth canals. The construction of the human pelvis  differs from other
 primates, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth  is more difficult and
dangerous than in most mammals, especially given the larger head size of human babies  compared to other primates. This means that
human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal, which other primates do not do, and it makes humans the only
species where females require help from their conspecifics[clarification needed]  to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial 
evolutionary  solution, human fetuses are born less developed and more vulnerable. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more
developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another
difference between women and chimpanzee females is that women go through the menopause  and become unfertile  decades before the
end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it has
provided an evolutionary advantage (more caring time) to young relatives.[86]

Apart from bipedalism, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in smelling, hearing, digesting  proteins, brain size, and the
ability of language. Humans' brains  are about three times bigger than in chimpanzees. More importantly, the brain to body ratio
is much higher in humans than in chimpanzees, and humans have a significantly more developed cerebral cortex, with a larger number
of neurons. The mental abilities of humans are remarkable compared to other apes. Humans' ability of speech  is unique among
primates. Humans are able to create new and complex ideas, and to develop technology, which is unprecedented among other organisms 
 on Earth.[86]

It is estimated that the worldwide average height for an adult human  male is about 172 cm (5 ft 71⁄2 in),[citation needed]  while
the worldwide average height for adult human females is about 158 cm (5 ft 2 in).[citation needed]  Shrinkage of stature may begin
in middle age in some individuals, but tends to be typical in the extremely aged.[88]  Through history human populations have
universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions.[89]  The average mass 
 of an adult human is 54–64 kg (120–140 lb) for females and 76–83 kg (168–183 lb) for males.[90]  Like many other conditions, body
weight and body type is influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals. (see 
obesity)[91][92]

Although humans appear hairless compared to other primates, with notable hair  growth occurring chiefly on the top of the head, 
underarms  and pubic area, the average human has more hair follicles  on his or her body than the average chimpanzee. The main
distinction is that human hairs are shorter, finer, and less heavily pigmented than the average chimpanzee's, thus making them
harder to see.[93]  Humans have about 2 million sweat glands  spread over their entire bodies, many more than chimpanzees, whose
sweat glands are scarce and are mainly located on the palm of the hand and on the soles of the feet.[94]

The dental formula  of humans is: 2.1.2.32.1.2.3. Humans have proportionately shorter palates  and much smaller teeth  than other
primates. They are the only primates to have short, relatively flush canine teeth. Humans have characteristically crowded teeth,
with gaps from lost teeth usually closing up quickly in young individuals. Humans are gradually losing their wisdom teeth, with
some individuals having them congenitally absent.[95]

GENETICS
Main article: Human geneticsFurther information: Human evolutionary genetics
A graphical representation of the ideal human karyotype, including both the male and female variant of the sex chromosome (number
23).Like all mammals, humans are a diploid  eukaryotic  species. Each somatic  cell  has two sets of 23 chromosomes, each set received
from one parent; gametes  have only one set of chromosomes, which is a mixture of the two parental sets. Among the 23 pairs of
chromosomes there are 22 pairs of autosomes  and one pair of sex chromosomes. Like other mammals, humans have an XY
sex-determination system, so that females  have the sex chromosomes XX and males  have XY.[96]

One human genome  was sequenced in full in 2003, and currently efforts are being made to achieve a sample of the genetic diversity
of the species (see International HapMap Project). By present estimates, humans have approximately 22,000 genes.[97]  The
variation in human DNA is very small compared to other species, possibly suggesting a population bottleneck  during the Late
Pleistocene  (around 100,000 years ago), in which the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs.[98][99]  
Nucleotide diversity  is based on single mutations called single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs). The nucleotide diversity
between humans is about 0.1%, i.e. 1 difference per 1,000 base pairs.[100][101]  A difference of 1 in 1,000 nucleotides  between
two humans chosen at random amounts to about 3 million nucleotide differences, since the human genome has about 3 billion
nucleotides. Most of these single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) are neutral  but some (about 3 to 5%) are functional and
influence phenotypic  differences between humans through alleles.[citation needed]

By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly
steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor.
Each time a certain mutation (SNP) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants, a haplogroup  is formed
including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation. By comparing mitochondrial DNA, which is
inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in
all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 90,000 to 200,000 years ago.[102][103][104]

Human accelerated regions, first described in August 2006,[105][106]  are a set of 49 segments of the human genome  that are
conserved throughout vertebrate  evolution but are strikingly different in humans. They are named according to their degree of
difference between humans and their nearest animal relative (chimpanzees) (HAR1 showing the largest degree of human-chimpanzee
differences). Found by scanning through genomic databases of multiple species, some of these highly mutated  areas may contribute
to human-specific traits.[citation needed]

The forces of natural selection  have continued to operate on human populations, with evidence that certain regions of the genome 
display directional selection  in the past 15,000 years.[107]

LIFE CYCLE
See also: Childbirth  and Life expectancy
A 10 mm human embryo  at 5 weeksBoy  and girl  before pubertyYouth  male and femaleAdult  man  and womanElderly  man and womanAs
with other mammals, human reproduction  takes place as internal fertilization  by sexual intercourse. During this process, the
male inserts his erect penis  into the female's vagina  and ejaculates  semen, which contains sperm. The sperm travels through the
vagina and cervix into the uterus or Fallopian tubes for fertilization  of the ovum. Upon fertilization and implantation,
gestation then occurs within the female's uterus.

The zygote  divides inside the female's uterus to become an embryo, which over a period of 38 weeks (9 months) of gestation 
becomes a fetus. After this span of time, the fully grown fetus is birthed  from the woman's body and breathes independently as an
infant for the first time. At this point, most modern cultures recognize the baby as a person entitled to the full protection of
the law, though some jurisdictions extend various levels of personhood  earlier to human fetuses while they remain in the uterus.

Compared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous. Painful labors lasting 24 hours or more are not uncommon and sometimes
lead to the death of the mother, the child or both.[108]  This is because of both the relatively large fetal head circumference
and the mother's relatively narrow pelvis.[109][110]  The chances of a successful labor increased significantly during the 20th
century in wealthier countries with the advent of new medical technologies. In contrast, pregnancy and natural childbirth  remain
hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the world, with maternal death rates  approximately 100 times greater than in developed
countries.[111]

In developed countries, infants are typically 3–4 kg (6–9 pounds) in weight and 50–60 cm (20–24 inches) in height at birth.[112][
not in citation given]  However, low birth weight  is common in developing countries, and contributes to the high levels of 
infant
mortality  in these regions.[113]  Helpless at birth, humans continue to grow for some years, typically reaching sexual maturity 
at 12 to 15 years of age. Females continue to develop physically until around the age of 18, whereas male development continues
until around age 21. The human life span  can be split into a number of stages: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, 
adulthood  and old age. The lengths of these stages, however, have varied across cultures and time periods. Compared to other
primates, humans experience an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence, where the body grows 25% in size. Chimpanzees, for
example, grow only 14%, with no pronounced spurt.[114]  The presence of the growth spurt is probably necessary to keep children
physically small until they are psychologically mature. Humans are one of the few species in which females undergo menopause. It
has been proposed that menopause increases a woman's overall reproductive success by allowing her to invest more time and
resources in her existing offspring, and in turn their children (the grandmother hypothesis), rather than by continuing to bear
children into old age.[115][116]

For various reasons, including biological/genetic causes,[117]  women live on average about four years longer than men—as of 2013
the global average life expectancy at birth  of a girl is estimated at 70.2 years compared to 66.1 for a boy.[118]  There are
significant geographical variations in human life expectancy, mostly correlated with economic development—for example life
expectancy at birth in Hong Kong  is 84.8 years for girls and 78.9 for boys, while in Swaziland, primarily because of AIDS, it is
31.3 years for both sexes.[119]  The developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40 years. In the developing
world  the median age is between 15 and 20 years. While one in five Europeans is 60 years of age or older, only one in twenty
Africans is 60 years of age or older.[120]  The number of centenarians  (humans of age 100 years or older) in the world was
estimated by the United Nations  at 210,000 in 2002.[121]  At least one person, Jeanne Calment, is known to have reached the age
of 122 years;[122]  higher ages have been claimed but they are not well substantiated.

sources in regions of habitation, and also varying with cultural and religious norms, human groups have adopted a range of diets,
from purely vegetarian  to primarily carnivorous. In some cases, dietary restrictions in humans can lead to deficiency diseases;
however, stable human groups have adapted to many dietary patterns through both genetic specialization and cultural conventions to
use nutritionally balanced food sources.[125]  The human diet is prominently reflected in human culture, and has led to the
development of food science.

Until the development of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago, Homo sapiens  employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole
means of food collection. This involved combining stationary food sources (such as fruits, grains, tubers, and mushrooms, insect
larvae and aquatic mollusks) with wild game, which must be hunted and killed in order to be consumed.[126]  It has been proposed
that humans have used fire to prepare and cook  food since the time of Homo erectus.[127]  Around ten thousand years ago, humans
developed agriculture,[128]  which substantially altered their diet. This change in diet may also have altered human biology; with
the spread of dairy farming  providing a new and rich source of food, leading to the evolution of the ability to digest lactose 
in some adults.[129][130]  Agriculture led to increased populations, the development of cities, and because of increased
population density, the wider spread of infectious diseases. The types of food consumed, and the way in which they are prepared,
have varied widely by time, location, and culture.

In general, humans can survive for two to eight weeks without food, depending on stored body fat. Survival without water is
usually limited to three or four days. About 36 million humans die every year from causes directly or indirectly related to
starvation.[131]  Childhood malnutrition is also common and contributes to the global burden of disease.[132]  However global food
distribution is not even, and obesity  among some human populations has increased rapidly, leading to health complications and
increased mortality in some developed, and a few developing countries. Worldwide over one billion people are obese,[133]  while in
the United States 35% of people are obese, leading to this being described as an "obesity epidemic."[134]  Obesity is caused by
consuming more calories  than are expended, so excessive weight gain is usually caused by an energy-dense diet.[133]

BIOLOGICAL VARIATION
Main article: Human genetic variation
People in warm climates are often slender and dark skinned, such as these Maasai  men from Kenya.
People in cold climates tend to be lighter skinned such as these Inuit  women from Canada.No two humans—not even monozygotic twins—are genetically identical. Genes  and environment  influence human biological variation
from visible characteristics to physiology to disease susceptibly to mental abilities. The exact influence of genes and
environment  on certain traits is not well understood.[135][136]

Most current genetic  and archaeological  evidence supports a recent single origin of modern humans  in East Africa,[137]  with
first migrations placed at 60,000 years ago. Compared to the great apes, human gene sequences—even among African  populations—are 
remarkably homogeneous.[138]  On average, genetic similarity between any two humans is 99.9%.[139][140]  There is about 2–3 times
more genetic diversity within the wild chimpanzee population, than in the entire human gene pool.[141][142][143]

The human body's ability to adapt  to different environmental stresses is remarkable, allowing humans to acclimatize to a wide
variety of temperatures, humidity, and altitudes. As a result, humans are a cosmopolitan species found in almost all regions of
the world, including tropical rainforests, arid desert, extremely cold arctic regions, and heavily polluted cities. Most other
species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited adaptability.[144]

There is biological variation in the human species—with traits such as blood type, cranial features, eye color, hair color  and
type, height  and build, and skin color  varying across the globe. Human body types vary substantially. The typical height of an
adult human is between 1.4 m and 1.9 m (4 ft 7 in and 6 ft 3 in), although this varies significantly depending, among other
things, on sex  and ethnic origin.[145][146]  Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by
environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns, especially as an influence in childhood. Adult height for each
sex in a particular ethnic group approximately follows a normal distribution. Those aspects of genetic variation that give clues
to human evolutionary history, or are relevant to medical research, have received particular attention. For example, the genes
that allow adult humans to digest lactose  are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle
domestication, suggesting natural selection having favored that gene in populations that depend on cow milk. Some hereditary
diseases such as sickle cell anemia  are frequent in populations where malaria  has been endemic throughout history—it is believed
that the same gene gives increased resistance to malaria among those who are unaffected carriers of the gene. Similarly,
populations that have for a long time inhabited specific climates, such as arctic or tropical regions or high altitudes, tend to
have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for conserving energy in those environments—short stature and stocky build
in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities at high altitudes. Similarly, skin color varies 
clinally  with darker skin around the equator—where the added protection from the sun's ultraviolet radiation is thought to give
an evolutionary advantage—and lighter skin tones closer to the poles.[147][148][149][150]

The hue of human skin and hair is determined by the presence of pigments  called melanins. Human skin color can range from 
darkest
brown  to lightest peach, or even nearly white or colorless in cases of albinism.[143]  Human hair ranges in color from white  to 
red  to blond  to brown  to black, which is most frequent.[151]  Hair color depends on the amount of melanin (an effective sun
blocking pigment) in the skin  and hair, with hair melanin concentrations in hair fading with increased age, leading to grey  or
even white hair. Most researchers believe that skin darkening is an adaptation that evolved as protection against ultraviolet
solar radiation, which also helps balancing folate, which is destroyed by ultraviolet radiation. Light skin pigmentation protects
against depletion of vitamin D, which requires sunlight  to make.[152]  Skin pigmentation of contemporary humans is clinally
distributed across the planet, and in general correlates with the level of ultraviolet radiation in a particular geographic area.
Human skin also has a capacity to darken (tan) in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.[153][154][155]

STRUCTURE OF VARIATION

The ancestors of Native Americans, such as this Yanomami  woman, crossed into the Americas from Northeast Asia, and genetic and
linguistic evidence links them to North Asian populations, particularly those of East Siberia.[156]
An older adult human male European in Paris – playing chess at the Jardins du Luxembourg.Within the human species, the greatest
degree of genetic variation exists between males and females. While the nucleotide  genetic variation of individuals of the same
sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1%, the genetic difference between males  and females  is between 1% and 2%.
Although different in nature[clarification needed], this approaches the genetic differentiation between men and male chimpanzees
or women and female chimpanzees. The genetic difference between sexes contributes to anatomical, hormonal, neural, and
physiological differences between men and women, although the exact degree and nature of social and environmental influences on
sexes are not completely understood. Males on average are 15% heavier and 15 cm taller than females. There is a difference between
body types, body organs and systems, hormonal levels, sensory systems, and muscle mass between sexes. On average, there is a
difference of about 40–50% in upper body strength and 20–30% in lower body strength between men and women. Women generally have a
higher body fat  percentage than men. Women have lighter skin  than men of the same population; this has been explained by a
higher need for vitamin D (which is synthesized by sunlight) in females during pregnancy  and lactation. As there are chromosomal
differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome related conditions and disorders  only affect either men or women.
Other conditional differences between males and females are not related to sex chromosomes. Even after allowing for body weight
and volume, the male voice  is usually an octave  deeper than the female voice. Women have a longer life span  in almost every
population around the world.[157][158][159][160][161][162][163][164][165]

Males typically have larger tracheae  and branching bronchi, with about 30% greater lung volume  per unit body mass. They have
larger hearts, 10% higher red blood cell  count, and higher hemoglobin, hence greater oxygen-carrying capacity. They also have
higher circulating clotting factors  (vitamin K, prothrombin  and platelets). These differences lead to faster healing of wounds 
and higher peripheral pain tolerance.[166]  Females typically have more white blood cells  (stored and circulating), more 
granulocytes  and B and T lymphocytes. Additionally, they produce more antibodies  at a faster rate than males. Hence they develop
fewer infectious  diseases and these continue for shorter periods.[166]  Ethologists  argue that females, interacting with other
females and multiple offspring in social groups, have experienced such traits as a selective  advantage.[167][168][169][170][171] 
According to Daly and Wilson, "The sexes differ more in human beings than in monogamous  mammals, but much less than in extremely 
polygamous  mammals."[172]  But given that sexual dimorphism  in the closest relatives of humans is much greater than among
humans, the human clade must be considered to be characterized by decreasing sexual dimorphism, probably due to less competitive
mating patterns. One proposed explanation is that human sexuality has developed more in common with its close relative the bonobo,
which exhibits similar sexual dimorphism, is polygynandrous  and uses recreational sex  to reinforce social bonds and reduce
aggression.[173]

Humans of the same sex are 99.9% genetically identical. There is extremely little variation between human geographical
populations, and most of the variation that does occur is at the personal level within local areas, and not between populations.
[143][174][175]  Of the 0.1% of human genetic differentiation, 85% exists within any randomly chosen local population, be they
Italians, Koreans, or Kurds. Two randomly chosen Koreans may be genetically as different as a Korean and an Italian. Any ethnic
group contains 85% of the human genetic diversity of the world. Genetic data shows that no matter how population groups are
defined, two people from the same population group are about as different from each other as two people from any two different
population groups.[143][176][177][178]

Current genetic research has demonstrated that humans on the African continent  are the most genetically diverse.[179]  There is
more human genetic diversity in Africa than anywhere else on Earth. The genetic structure of Africans was traced to 14 ancestral
population clusters. Human genetic diversity decreases in native populations with migratory distance from Africa and this is
thought to be the result of bottlenecks  during human migration.[180][181]  Humans have lived in Africa for the longest time,
which has allowed accumulation of a higher diversity of genetic mutations in these populations. Only part of Africa's population
migrated out of the continent, bringing just part of the original African genetic variety with them. African populations harbor
genetic alleles that are not found in other places of the world. All the common alleles found in populations outside of Africa are
found on the African continent.[143]

Geographical distribution of human variation is complex and constantly shifts through time which reflects complicated human
evolutionary history. Most human biological variation is clinally  distributed and blends gradually from one area to the next.
Groups of people around the world have different frequencies of polymorphic  genes. Furthermore, different traits are
non-concordant and each have different clinal distribution. Adaptability varies both from person to person and from population to
population. The most efficient adaptive responses are found in geographical populations where the environmental stimuli are the
strongest (e.g. Tibetans  are highly adapted to high altitudes). The clinal geographic genetic variation is further complicated by
the migration and mixing between human populations which has been occurring since prehistoric times.[143][182][183][184][185][186]

Human variation is highly non-concordant: most of the genes do not cluster together and are not inherited together. Skin and hair
color are not correlated to height, weight, or athletic ability. Human species do not share the same patterns of variation through
geography. Skin color varies with latitude and certain people are tall or have brown hair. There is a statistical correlation
between particular features in a population, but different features are not expressed or inherited together. Thus, genes which
code for superficial physical traits—such as skin color, hair color, or height—represent a minuscule and insignificant portion of
the human genome and do not correlate with genetic affinity. Dark-skinned populations that are found in Africa, Australia, and
South Asia are not closely related to each other.[155][185][186][187][188][189]  Even within the same region, physical phenotype
is not related to genetic affinity: dark-skinned Ethiopians  are more closely related to light-skinned Armenians  than to
dark-skinned Bantu  populations.[190]  Despite pygmy  populations of South East Asia  (Andamanese) having similar physical
features with African pygmy populations such as short stature, dark skin, and curly hair, they are not genetically closely related
to these populations.[191]  Genetic variants affecting superficial anatomical features (such as skin color)—from a genetic
perspective, are essentially meaningless—they involve a few hundred of the billions of nucleotides in a person's DNA.[192] 
Individuals with the same morphology do not necessarily cluster with each other by lineage, and a given lineage does not include
only individuals with the same trait complex.[143][177][193]

Due to practices of group endogamy, allele frequencies cluster locally around kin groups and lineages, or by national, ethnic,
cultural and linguistic boundaries, giving a detailed degree of correlation between genetic clusters and population groups when
considering many alleles simultaneously. Despite this, there are no genetic boundaries around local populations that biologically
mark off any discrete groups  of humans. Human variation is continuous, with no clear points of demarcation. There are no large
clusters of relatively homogeneous people and almost every individual has genetic alleles from several ancestral groups.[143][184]

PSYCHOLOGY
Main article: PsychologyFurther information: Human brain  and Mind
Drawing of the human brain, showing several important structuresThe human brain, the focal point of the central nervous system  in humans, controls the peripheral nervous system. In addition to
controlling "lower," involuntary, or primarily autonomic  activities such as respiration  and digestion, it is also the locus of
"higher" order functioning such as thought, reasoning, and abstraction.[202]  These cognitive processes  constitute the mind, and,
along with their behavioral  consequences, are studied in the field of psychology.

Generally regarded as more capable of these higher order activities, the human brain is believed to be more "intelligent" in
general than that of any other known species. While some non-human species are capable of creating structures and using simple
tools—mostly through instinct and mimicry—human technology is vastly more complex, and is constantly evolving and improving
through time.

SLEEP AND DREAMING
Main articles: Sleep  and DreamHumans are generally diurnal. The average sleep requirement is between seven and nine hours per day for an adult and nine to ten
hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. Having less sleep than this is common among
humans, even though sleep deprivation  can have negative health effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per
day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including reduced memory, fatigue, aggression, and
bodily discomfort.[203]  During sleep humans dream. In dreaming humans experience sensory images and sounds, in a sequence which
the dreamer usually perceives more as an apparent participant than as an observer. Dreaming is stimulated by the pons  and mostly
occurs during the REM phase of sleep.

CONSCIOUSNESS AND THOUGHT
Main articles: Consciousness  and CognitionHumans are one of the relatively few species to have sufficient self-awareness to recognize themselves in a mirror.[204]  Already
at 18 months, most human children are aware that the mirror image is not another person.[205]

Humans in a lecture at the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, CTU, in Prague.The human brain perceives  the external world through the senses, and each individual human is influenced greatly by his or her
experiences, leading to subjective  views of existence  and the passage of time. Humans are variously said to possess
consciousness, self-awareness, and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of thought. These are said to possess
qualities such as self-awareness, sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself  and one's 
environment. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions
and validity of many of the terms used above.

The physical aspects of the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, are studied in the field of neurology, the
more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats
mental illness and behavioral disorders. Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed
purely in terms of phenomenological  or information processing  theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of
brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, 
neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience.

The nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. Cognitive psychology  studies cognition, the mental processes' 
underlying behavior. It uses information processing  as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem
solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a
school of thought known as cognitivism, whose adherents argue for an information processing  model of mental function, informed by
 positivism  and experimental psychology. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay
of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing on the development of the human
mind through the life span, developmental psychology  seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within
the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral
development.

Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which
is the processing of the things in experience.[206]  Phenomenal consciousness is the state of being conscious, such as when they
say "I am conscious." Access consciousness is being conscious of  something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one
says "I am conscious of these words." Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, stream
of consciousness, Husserl's phenomenology, and intentionality. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history,
according to some, is closely related to the concept of qualia. Social psychology  links sociology with psychology in their shared
study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they
relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through animal cognition, 
ethology, evolutionary psychology, and comparative psychology  as well. Human ecology  is an academic discipline  that
investigates how humans and human societies  interact with both their natural environment and the human social environment.

MOTIVATION AND EMOTION
Main articles: Motivation  and Emotion
Illustration of grief from Charles Darwin's book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.Motivation is the driving force
of desire behind all deliberate actions  of humans. Motivation is based on emotion—specifically, on the search for satisfaction 
(positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative is defined by the individual brain state,
which may be influenced by social norms: a person may be driven to self-injury  or violence  because their brain  is conditioned
to create a positive response to these actions. Motivation is important because it is involved in the performance of all learned
responses. Within psychology, conflict avoidance  and the libido  are seen to be primary motivators. Within economics, motivation
is often seen to be based on incentives; these may be financial, moral, or coercive. Religions  generally posit divine or demonic 
influences.

Happiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical 
topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have—a condition of mental  and physical health. Others
define it as freedom  from want and distress; consciousness of the good  order of things; assurance of one's place in the universe 
 or society.

Emotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many cultures  and 
philosophers  have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as 
pleasant, such as love, admiration, or joy, contrast with those perceived as unpleasant, like hate, envy, or sorrow. There is
often a distinction made between refined emotions that are socially learned and survival  oriented emotions, which are thought to
be innate. Human exploration of emotions as separate from other neurological phenomena is worthy of note, particularly in cultures
where emotion is considered separate from physiological state. In some cultural medical theories emotion is considered so
synonymous with certain forms of physical health that no difference is thought to exist. The Stoics  believed excessive emotion
was harmful, while some Sufi  teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated
as ecstasy.

In modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of domesticated 
and non-domesticated mammals. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent
interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from
natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited
acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.

SEXUALITY AND LOVE
Main articles: Love  and Human sexuality
Human parents continue caring for their offspring long after they are born.For humans, sexuality has important social functions:
it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological reproduction. Sexual desire or 
libido, is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, ecstasy  and jealousy. The
significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected in a number of physical features among them hidden ovulation, the
evolution of external scrotum  and penis  suggesting sperm competition, the absence of an os penis, permanent secondary sexual
characteristics  and the forming of pair bonds  based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other
primates that often advertise estrus  through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation,
plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods. These adaptations indicate that the meaning of sexuality in
humans is similar to that found in the bonobo, and that the complex human sexual behavior has a long evolutionary  history.[207]

Human choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by cultural norms which vary widely. Restrictions are often
determined by religious beliefs or social customs. The pioneering researcher Sigmund Freud  believed that humans are born 
polymorphously perverse, which means that any number of objects could be a source of pleasure. According to Freud humans then pass
through five stages of psychosexual development  and can fixate on any stage because of various traumas during the process. For 
Alfred Kinsey, another influential sex researcher, people can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of sexual orientation, with
only small minorities fully heterosexual  or homosexual.[208]  Recent studies of neurology  and genetics  suggest people may be
born predisposed to various sexual tendencies.[209]

Humans often live in family-based social structures.Humans are highly social beings and tend to live in large complex social
groups. More than any other creature, humans are capable of utilizing systems of communication  for self-expression, the exchange
of ideas, and organization, and as such have created complex social structures  composed of many cooperating and competing groups.
Human groups range from the size of families to nations. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide
variety[clarification needed]  of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human society.

Culture is defined here as patterns of complex symbolic behavior, i.e. all behavior that is not innate but which has to be learned
through social interaction with others; such as the use of distinctive material  and symbolic systems, including language, ritual,
social organization, traditions, beliefs and technology.

LANGUAGE
While many species communicate, language  is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a cultural universal. Unlike
the limited systems of other animals, human language is open – an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a
limited number of symbols. Human language also has the capacity of displacement, using words to represent things and happenings
that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.[95]  Language differs from
other forms of communication in that it is modality independent; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media,
auditively in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and even through tactile media such as braille. Language is central to
the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of
writing systems at least five thousand years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major
technological advancement. The science of linguistics  describes the structure and function of language and the relationship
between languages. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including sign languages, and many
thousands more that are extinct.[214]

GENDER ROLES
Main articles: Gender role  and GenderThe sexual division of humans into male and female has been marked culturally by a
corresponding division of roles, norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power. Cultural
differences  by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological
fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children. Gender roles have
varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.

KINSHIP
Main articles: Kinship  and MarriageSessue Hayakawa  (left) with actress and wife Tsuru Aoki  in a screen shot of the 1919 film 
The Dragon Painter.All human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between
parents and children (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). These kinds of relations are generally called
kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that
are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be
regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form descent groups, groups of people sharing a common line of
descent, which can function as political units such as clans. Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through
marriage, forming kinship alliances  between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important
political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level.
Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of incest
taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited – such rules vary widely between
cultures.[citation needed]  Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with
either cross or parallel cousins. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the
systems of kinship terminology  in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed
through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity
(nurture kinship).

ETHNICITY
Main article: Ethnic groupHumans often form ethnic groups, such groups tend to be larger than kinship networks and be organized
around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared
biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated in the form of powerful, compelling
narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values. Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of
political organization such as the band, tribe, city state  or nation. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through
history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such
ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining social identity  and in constructing solidarity between members of an
ethno-political unit. This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state  as the
predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th century.[215][216][217][218][219][220]

SOCIETY, GOVERNMENT, AND POLITICS
Main articles: Origins of society, Society, Government, Politics, and State (polity)
The United Nations  Headquarters  in New York City, which houses one of the largest political organizations in the world
Russian honor guard at Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.Society is the system of organizations and institutions arising from
interaction between humans. A state is an organized political community occupying a definite territory, having an organized
government, and possessing internal and external sovereignty. Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states,
enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The "state" can also
be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by Max Weber, "a state is a human community that
(successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory."[221]

Government can be defined as the political means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a bureaucratic  hierarchy. Politics
is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the
term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including
corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of
understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, Communist state, military dictatorship
, theocracy, and liberal democracy, the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship
with economics.

TRADE AND ECONOMICS
Main articles: Trade  and EconomicsBuyers  and sellers  bargaining  in a marketTrade is the voluntary exchange of goods and
services, and is a form of economics. A mechanism that allows trade is called a market. Modern traders instead generally negotiate
through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. Because of
specialization and division of labor, most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor
for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an absolute  or comparative advantage  in the production
of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of mass production.

Economics is a social science  which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics
focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which deals with individual
agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers 
aggregate supply  and demand  for money, capital  and commodities. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are 
resource allocation, production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that
involves choice under scarcity or determining economic value.

WAR
Main article: WarWar is a state of organized armed conflict between states  or non-state actors. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence 
 against others – whether between combatants  or upon non-combatants  – to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often
spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, riots, revolts, and melees, are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions  can be 
nonviolent  or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that
between 167 and 188 million people died as a result of war.[222]  A common definition defines war as a series of military
campaigns  between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over sovereignty, territory, resources, religion, or other
issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a civil war. Among animals, all-out war against fellow members of the same
species occurs only among large societies of humans and ants.[citation needed]

There have been a wide variety of rapidly advancing  tactics  throughout the history of war, ranging from conventional war  to 
asymmetric warfare  to total war  and unconventional warfare. Techniques include hand to hand combat, the use of ranged weapons, 
naval warfare, and, more recently, air support. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and
defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role both in maintaining
unity within a warring group and in sowing discord among opponents. In modern warfare, soldiers  and combat vehicles  are used to
control the land, warships  the sea, and aircraft  the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of marines, 
paratroopers, aircraft carriers, and surface-to-air missiles, among others. Satellites  in low Earth orbit  have made outer space
a factor in warfare as well as it is used for detailed intelligence gathering, however no known aggressive actions have been 
taken
from space.

MATERIAL CULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY
Main articles: Tool  and Technology
An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.Stone tools were used by
proto-humans at least 2.5 million years ago.[223]  The controlled use of fire  began around 1.5 million years ago. Since then,
humans have made major advances, developing complex technology to create tools to aid their lives and allowing for other
advancements in culture. Major leaps in technology include the discovery of agriculture – what is known as the Neolithic
Revolution, and the invention of automated machines in the Industrial Revolution.

Archaeology  attempts to tell the story of past or lost cultures in part by close examination of the artifacts  they produced.
Early humans left stone tools, pottery, and jewelry  that are particular to various regions and times.

BODY CULTURE
Main articles: Clothing, Body modification, and HaircutThroughout history, humans have altered their appearance by wearing
clothing[224]  and adornments, by trimming or shaving  hair or by means of body modifications.

Body modification is the deliberate altering of the human body  for any non-medical reason, such as aesthetics, sexual
enhancement, a rite of passage, religious reasons, to display group membership or affiliation, to create body art, shock value, or
self-expression.[225]  In its most broad definition it includes plastic surgery, socially acceptable decoration (e.g. common ear
piercing  in many societies), and religious rites of passage (e.g. circumcision  in a number of cultures).[225]

PHILOSOPHY AND SELF-REFLECTION
Main articles: Philosophy  and Human self-reflectionSee also: Human nature
Statue of Confucius  on Chongming Island  in ShanghaiPhilosophy is a discipline or field of study involving the investigation,
analysis, and development of ideas at a general, abstract, or fundamental level. It is the discipline searching for a general
understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include logic, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy
of
mind, and axiology  (which includes ethics  and aesthetics). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to
refer to a worldview, to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of
philosophy.

RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
Main articles: Religion  and SpiritualityReligion is generally defined as a belief  system concerning the supernatural, sacred  or divine, and practices, values,
institutions and rituals  associated with such belief. Some religions also have a moral code. The evolution  and the history of
the first religions  have recently become areas of active scientific investigation.[226][227][228]  However, in the course of its 
development, religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and
issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an afterlife), the origin of life, the
nature of the universe  (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate  (eschatology), and what is moral  or immoral. A common source
for answers to these questions are beliefs in transcendent  divine  beings such as deities  or a singular God, although not all
religions are theistic. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the soul  or spirit, is one of the many different
approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the meaning of life, and
the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science,
spirituality is unique in that it focuses on mystical  or supernatural concepts such as karma  and God.

Although the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,[229]  a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or
spiritual belief, although many (in some countries a majority) are irreligious. This includes humans who have no religious beliefs
or do not identify with any religion. Humanism  is a philosophy which seeks to include all of humanity and all issues common to
humans; it is usually non-religious. Most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a
philosophical and methodological level; the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive and a majority of humans hold a
mix of both scientific and religious views. The distinction between philosophy and religion, on the other hand, is at times less
clear, and the two are linked in such fields as the philosophy of religion  and theology.

ART, MUSIC, AND LITERATURE
Main articles: Art, Music, and LiteratureAllegory of Music  (ca. 1594), a painting  of a woman writing sheet music  by Lorenzo
LippiArt is a cultural universal, and humans have been producing artistic works at least since the days of Cro Magnon. Art may be
defined as a form of cultural  expression and the usage of narratives  of liberation and exploration (i.e. art history, art
criticism, and art theory) to mediate its boundaries. This distinction may be applied to objects or performances, current or
historical, and its prestige extends to those who made, found, exhibit, or own them. In the modern use of the word, art is
commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works that, from concept to creation, adhere to the "creative
impulse" of human beings. Art is distinguished from other works by being in large part unprompted by necessity, by biological
drive, or by any undisciplined pursuit of recreation.

Music is a natural intuitive  phenomenon based on the three distinct and interrelated organization structures of rhythm, harmony,
and melody. Listening to music is perhaps the most common and universal form of entertainment, while learning and understanding it
are popular disciplines.[citation needed]  There are a wide variety of music genres  and ethnic musics. Literature, the body of
written—and possibly oral—works, especially creative ones, includes prose, poetry and drama, both fiction and non-fiction.
Literature includes such genres as epic, legend, myth, ballad, and folklore.

SCIENCE
Main article: ScienceAnother unique aspect of human culture and thought is the development of complex methods for acquiring
knowledge through observation, quantification, and verification. The scientific method  has been developed to acquire knowledge of
the physical world and the rules, processes and principles of which it consists, and combined with mathematics it enables the
prediction of complex patterns of causality and consequence. Some other animals are able to recognize differences in small
quantities,[citation needed]  but humans are able to understand and recognize much larger, even abstract, quantities, and to
recognize and understand algorithmic patterns which enables infinite counting  routines and algebra, something that is not found
in any other species.

      against what is known about our ever-changing and complex biological diversity.

      populations are characterized by gradual changes across geographic regions, not sharp, categorical distinctions. Groups of
      people across the globe have varying frequencies of polymorphic genes, which are genes with any of several differing
      nucleotide sequences. There is no such thing as a set of genes that belongs exclusively to one group and not to another. The
      clinal, gradually changing nature of geographic genetic difference is complicated further by the migration and mixing that
      human groups have engaged in since prehistory. Genetic studies have substantiated the absence of clear biological borders;
      thus the term "race" is rarely used in scientific terminology, either in biological anthropology and in human genetics. Race
      has no genetic or biological basis. Human beings do not fit the zoological definition of race. Race is not a biological
      category that is politically charged. It is a political category that has been disguised as a biological one.

Rights  are legal, social, or ethical principles  of freedom  or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative  rules
about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.[1] 
Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law  and ethics, especially theories of justice  and deontology.

Rights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society  and culture,[2]  and
the history of social conflicts  can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality  as it is
currently perceived."[1]



DEFINITIONAL ISSUES
Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest civil disobedience  is, itself, a
 right, and it was advocated by thinkers such as Henry David Thoreau, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term rights. It has been used by different groups and
thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle,
beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many
diverse things are claimed as rights:

“A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to
operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to
sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a
right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.[1]”
There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:

“Who  is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. What
actions or states or objects  the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to
remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. Why  the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral
reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. How the asserted right
can be affected  by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable
right that a promise be kept.[1]”There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community,
particularly within fields such as philosophy, law, deontology, logic, political science, and religion.

NATURAL RIGHTS VERSUS LEGAL RIGHTS
According to some views, certain rights derive from God  or NatureMain article: Natural and legal rights * Natural rights  are rights which are "natural" in the sense of "not artificial, not man-made", as in rights deriving from 
   deontic logic, from human nature, or from the edicts of a god. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do
   not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away.
   For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural right to life. These are sometimes called moral rights  or 
   inalienable rights.
 * Legal rights, in contrast, are based on a society's customs, laws, statutes  or actions by legislatures. An example of a legal
   right is the right to vote  of citizens. Citizenship, itself, is often considered as the basis for having legal rights, and has
   been defined as the "right to have rights". Legal rights are sometimes called civil rights  or statutory rights  and are
   culturally and politically relative  since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning.

Some thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been
considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, Jeremy Bentham  believed that legal rights
were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas Thomas Aquinas  held that rights purported by 
positive law  but not grounded in natural law  were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights.8

CLAIM RIGHTS VERSUS LIBERTY RIGHTS
A deed  is an example of a claim right  in the sense that it asserts a right  to own land. This particular deed dates back to
1273.Main article: Claim rights and liberty rights * A claim right  is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain
   from doing something to or for the claim holder, such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or
   she has a claim  to that service or product (another term is thing in action).[3]  In logic, this idea can be expressed as:
   "Person A  has a claim that person B  do something if and only if B  has a duty to A  to do that something." Every claim-right
   entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from
   acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like "life, liberty, and property"; these rights
   impose an obligation upon others not  to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's
   permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be
   provided with those services.[citation needed]
 * A liberty right  or privilege, in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there
   are no obligations  on other parties to do or not do anything.[3]  This can be expressed in logic as: "Person A  has a
   privilege to do something if and only if A  has no duty not to do that something." For example, if a person has a legal liberty
   right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does not  mean that
   anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from
   speaking, though other  rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop
   them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only
if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against
someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a liberty right  to walk down a sidewalk and
can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But
pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other
people have a claim right. So a person's liberty right  of walking extends precisely to the point where another's claim right 
limits his or her freedom.

POSITIVE RIGHTS VERSUS NEGATIVE RIGHTS
Main article: Negative and positive rightsIn one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific
service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called positive rights. However, in another sense, rights may allow
or require inaction, and these are called negative rights; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some democracies
e.g. the US, citizens have the positive right  to vote and they have the negative right  to not vote; people can choose not to
vote in a given election without punishment. In other democracies e.g. Australia, however, citizens have a positive right to vote
but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since voting is compulsory. Accordingly:

 * Positive rights  are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the
   purported "right to welfare."[4]
 * Negative rights  are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by 
   libertarians  who think of a negative right  as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.[4]

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with active rights  (which encompass "privileges" and
"powers") and passive rights  (which encompass "claims" and "immunities").

INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS VERSUS GROUP RIGHTS
Main article: Individual and group rightsThe general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that
they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe.
This is the understanding of people such as the author Ayn Rand  who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her
philosophy known as Objectivism.[5]  However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought
to have rights, or group rights. Accordingly:

 * Individual rights  are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.

Do groups have rights? Some argue that when soldiers bond in combat, the group becomes like an organism in itself and has rights 
which trump the rights of any individual soldier. * Group rights  have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals
   but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to
   an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having rights.
   For example, a platoon of soldiers in combat  can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to
   risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a "right" which is superior
   to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a
   breach of obedience. But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as
   having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which
   individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a
   group such as a labor union  can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor
   union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement
   about what exactly is meant by the term "group" as well as by the term "group rights."[citation needed]

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is
conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the
union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called closed shop  which has a union security
agreement, only the union has a right  to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed
"individual rights" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the "group rights" of the union regarding the proper wage
prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

The Austrian School of Economics  holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group.
The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called
 methodological individualism  and is used by the economists to justify individual rights.

OTHER SENSES
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or family resemblance  than on precise philosophical
distinctions. These include the distinction between civil and political rights  and economic, social and cultural rights, between
which the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into 
three generations. These distinctions have much overlap with that between negative and positive rights, as well as between 
individual rights  and group rights, but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

RIGHTS AND POLITICS
In the United States, persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their "Miranda
rights". The Miranda warning  requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they
have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.Rights are often included in the
foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these
socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise
when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights. Issues of concern have historically
included labor rights, LGBT rights, reproductive rights, disability rights, patient rights  and prisoners' rights. With increasing
 monitoring  and the information society, information rights, such as the right to privacy  are becoming more important.

Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include animals,[6]  and amongst humans, groups such as children[7] 
 and youth, parents  (both mothers  and fathers), and men  and women.[8]

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which
behaviors are included as "rights" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political
orientation. Positive rights such as a "right to medical care" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while
right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the "right to a fair trial".

Further, the term equality  which is often bound up with the meaning of "rights" often depends on one's political orientation. 
Conservatives  and libertarians  and advocates of free markets  often identify equality with equality of opportunity, and want
equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In
contrast, socialists  often identify equality with equality of outcome  and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods
and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as health care  or economic
assistance  or housing.[9]

RIGHTS AND PHILOSOPHY
In philosophy, meta-ethics  is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical properties, statements,
attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others
being normative ethics  and applied ethics.

While normative ethics addresses such questions as "What should one do?", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting
others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as "What is  goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking
to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of what normative ethics is concerned with. (Metaethics also includes a
group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics). Rights ethics
holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative metaethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of
the following

 * Duties (deontology)
 * Value  (Axiology)
 * Virtue (virtue ethics)
 * Consequences (consequentialism, e.g. utilitarianism)

Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  gives
some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.

CRITICISM
Some philosophers have criticised rights as ontologically  dubious entities. For instance, although in favour of the extension of 
individual legal rights, the utilitarian  philosopher Jeremy Bentham  opposed the idea of natural law  and natural rights, calling
them "nonsense upon stilts".[10]  Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.

ETYMOLOGY
The Modern English  word right  derives from Old English  riht  or reht, in turn from Proto-Germanic  *riχtaz  meaning "right" or
"direct", and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European  *reg-to-  meaning "having moved in a straight line", in turn from *(o)reg'(a)- 
meaning "to straighten or direct".[11]  In several different Indo-European languages, a single word derived from the same root
means both "right" and "law", such as French droit,[12]  Spanish derecho,[13]  German Recht.[14]  and Italian diritto.

Many other words related to normative or regulatory concepts derive from this same root, including correct,[15]  regulate,[16] 
and rex[17]  (meaning "king"), whence regal[18]  and thence royal.[19]  Likewise many more geometric terms derive from this same
root, such as erect  (as in "upright"),[20]  rectangle  (literally "right angle"),[21]  straight[22]  and stretch.[23]  Like right
, the English words rule[24]  and ruler,[25]  deriving still from the same root, have both normative or regulatory and geometric
meanings (e.g. a ruler as in a king, or a ruler as in a straightedge).

Several other roots have similar normative and geometric descendants, such as Latin norma,[26]  whence norm,[27]  normal,[28]  and
 normative[29]  itself, and also geometric concepts such as normal vectors; and likewise Greek ortho[30]  and Latin ordo,[31] 
meaning either "right" or "correct" (as in orthodox, meaning "correct opinion"[32]) or "straight" or "perpendicular" (as in 
orthogonal, meaning "perpendicular angle"[33]), and thence order,[34]  ordinary,[35]  etc.

HISTORY OF RIGHTS
See also: History of human rights
The Magna Carta  or "Great Charter" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a king  to his people to
respect certain legal  rights. It reduced the power of the monarch.
The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen  in 1789 in France.The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly
in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter
conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue,
constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.

Historically, many notions of rights were authoritarian  and hierarchical, with different people granted different rights, and
some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to respected from his son did not indicate a right from
the son to receive a return from that respect; and the divine right of kings, which permitted absolute power over subjects, did
not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.[36]

In contrast, modern conceptions of rights often emphasize liberty  and equality  as among the most important aspects of rights,
for example in the American Revolution  and the French Revolution.

Important documents in the political history  of rights include:

 * The Constitution of Medina  (622 AD; Arabia) instituted a number of rights for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of
   Medina,[37]  establishing freedom of worship for non-Muslims the security of women, a system for granting protection to
   individuals, and a judicial system.
 * The Magna Carta  (1215; England) required the King of England  to renounce certain rights and respect certain legal procedures,
   and to accept that the will of the king could be bound by law, after King John promised his barons he would follow the "law of
   the land". While Magna Carta was originally a set of rules that the king had to follow, and mainly protected the property of
   aristocratic landowners, today the Magna Carta is seen as the basis of certain rights for ordinary people, such as the right of
   due process.[38]
 * The Declaration of Arbroath  (1320; Scotland) established the right of the people to choose a head of state (see Popular
   sovereignty).
 * The Henrician Articles  (1573; Poland-Lithuania) or King Henry's Articles were a permanent contract that stated the fundamental
   principles of governance and constitutional law in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including the rights of the nobility to
   elect the king, to meet in parliament whose approval was required to levy taxes and declare war or peace, to religious liberty
   and the right to rebel in case the king transgressed against the laws of the republic or the rights of the nobility.
 * The Bill of Rights  (1689; England) declared that Englishmen, as embodied by Parliament, possess certain civil and political
   rights; the Claim of Right  (1689; Scotland) was similar but distinct.
 * The Virginia Declaration of Rights  (1776) by George Mason  declared the inherent natural rights and separation of powers.
 * United States Declaration of Independence  (1776) succinctly defined the rights of man as including, but not limited to, "
   Life,
   liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" which later influenced "liberté, égalité, fraternité" (liberty, equality, fraternity) in
   France[39]  The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan,[40]  and in President 
   Ho
   Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.[41]  An alternative phrase "life, liberty
   and property", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. Also, Article 3
   of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person."
 * The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen  (1789; France), one of the fundamental documents of the French
   Revolution, defined a set of individual rights and collective rights of the people.
 * The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom  (1785; United States) Written by Thomas Jefferson  in 1779, the document asserted
   the right of man to form a personal relationship with God without interference by the state.
 * The United States Bill of Rights  (1789–1791; United States), the first ten amendments of the United States Constitution 
   specified rights of individuals in which government could not interfere, including the rights of free assembly, freedom of
   religion, trial by jury, and the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.
 * The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  (1948) is an overarching set of standards by which governments, organisations and
   individuals would measure their behaviour towards each other.[citation needed]  The preamble declares that the "...recognition
   of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom
   , justice  and peace  in the world..."
 * The European Convention on Human Rights  (1950; Europe) was adopted under the auspices of the Council of Europe  to protect 
   human rights  and fundamental freedoms.
 * The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  (1966), a follow-up to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
   concerns civil and political rights.
 * The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  (1966), another follow-up to the Universal Declaration of
   Human Rights, concerns economic, social and cultural rights.
 * The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (1982; Canada) was created to protect the rights of Canadian  citizens from
   actions and policies of all levels of government.[citation needed]
 * The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (2000) is one of the most recent proposed legal instruments 
   concerning human rights.

Hurrah!  (1888) by Peder Severin Krøyer, a painting portraying an artists' party in 19th century Denmark
A September 1945 street party  in Selborne Road, Kent, celebrating victory in the Second World WarA party  is a gathering of people who have been invited by a host  for the purposes of socializing, conversation, recreation, or
as part of a festival  or other commemoration of a special occasion. A party will typically feature food  and beverages, and often
 music  and dancing  or other forms of entertainment. In many Western countries, parties for teens and adults are associated with
drinking alcohol such as beer, wine  or distilled spirits.



DESCRIPTION
Some parties are held in honor  of a specific person, day, or event, such as a birthday party, a Super Bowl  party, or a St.
Patrick’s Day  party. Parties of this kind are often called celebrations. A party is not necessarily a private occasion. Public
parties are sometimes held in restaurants, pubs, beer gardens, nightclubs  or bars, and people attending such parties may be
charged an admission fee by the host. Large parties in public streets may celebrate events such as Mardi Gras  or the signing of a
 peace treaty  ending a long war.

TYPES OF PARTIES
BIRTHDAY PARTY
"Birthday party" redirects here. For other uses, see Birthday party (disambiguation).
A birthday cake  with lit novelty candles
Children at a birthday partyA birthday  party is a celebration of the anniversary  of the birth of the person who is being honored. The tradition started in
the mid-nineteenth century but did not become popular until the mid-twentieth century.[1]  Birthday parties are now a feature of
many cultures.

In Western cultures, birthday parties include a number of common rituals. The guests may be asked to bring a gift for the honored
person. Party locations are often decorated with colorful decorations, such as balloons  and streamers. A birthday cake  is
usually served with lit candles that are to be blown out after a "birthday wish" has been made. The person being honored will be
given the first piece of cake. While the birthday cake is being brought to the table, the song "Happy Birthday to You" or some
other birthday song is sung by the guests.

At parties for children, time is often taken for the "gift opening" wherein the individual whose birthday is celebrated opens each
of the gifts brought. It is also common at children's parties for the host to give parting gifts to the attendees in the form of
"goodie bags". Children and even adults sometimes wear colorful cone-shaped party hats.

Birthday parties are often larger and more extravagant if they celebrate someone who has reached what is regarded in the culture
as a milestone age, such as transition from childhood to adulthood. Examples of traditional coming of age  celebrations include
the North American sweet sixteen party  and the Latin American quinceañera.

SURPRISE PARTY
"Surprise party" redirects here. For other uses, see Surprise party (disambiguation).A surprise party is a party that is not made
known beforehand to the person in whose honor it is being held.

Birthday surprise parties are the most common kind of surprise party. At most such parties, the guests will arrive an hour or so
before the honored person arrives. Often, a friend in on the surprise will lead the honored person to the location of the party
without letting on anything.

The guests might even conceal themselves from view, and when the honored person enters the room, they leap from hiding and all
shout, "Surprise!" For some surprise birthday parties, it is considered to be a good tactic to shock the honored person.
Streamers, silly string, and balloons  may be used for this purpose. Evidence of a party, such as decorations and balloons, are
not made visible from the exterior of the home, so that the honored person will suspect nothing.

DINNER PARTY
A buffet (Smörgåsbord) set for a party on board a Swedish ship for Christmas 1990.A dinner party is a social gathering at which
people eat dinner  together, usually in the host’s home. At the most formal dinner parties, the dinner is served on a dining table
with place settings. Dinner parties are often preceded by a cocktail hour  in a living room or bar, where guests drink cocktails 
while mingling and conversing.[2]  Wine  is usually served throughout the meal, often with a different wine accompanying each
course.

At less formal dinner parties, a buffet  is provided. Guests choose food from the buffet and eat while standing up and conversing.
Women guests may wear cocktail dresses; men may wear blazers.

At some informal dinner parties, the host may ask guests to bring food or beverages  (a main dish, a side dish, a dessert, or 
appetizers). A party of this type is called a potluck  or potluck dinner. In the United States, potlucks are very often held in
churches and community centers.

GARDEN PARTY
A garden party is a party in a park  or a garden. An event described as a garden party is usually more formal than other outdoor
gatherings, which may be called simply parties, picnics, barbecues, etc. A garden party can be a prestigious event. For example,
invitations by the British Sovereign  to garden parties at Buckingham Palace  are considered an honor. The President of France
holds a garden party at the Palais de l'Elysée  in Paris on Bastille Day.

COCKTAIL PARTY
Main article: Cocktail partyA cocktail party is a party at which cocktails  are served. It is sometimes called a "cocktail reception". Women who attend a
cocktail party may wear a cocktail dress. A cocktail hat  is sometimes worn as a fashion statement.

TEA PARTY
An outdoor tea party in Australia (between 1900 and 1910)Main article: Tea party (social gathering)In Anglo-American culture, a tea  party is a formal gathering for afternoon tea. These parties were traditionally attended only by
women, but men may also be invited. Tea parties are often characterized by the use of prestigious tableware, such as bone china 
and silver. The table, whatever its size or cost, is made to look its prettiest, with cloth napkins and matching cups and plates.

In addition to tea, larger parties may serve punch or, in cold weather, hot chocolate. The tea is accompanied by a variety of
easily managed foods. Thin sandwiches  such as cucumber  or tomato, bananas, cake slices, buns, and cookies  are all common
choices.

RECEPTION
Reception at an art exhibition openingFormal receptions are parties that are designed to receive a large number of guests, often
at prestigious venues such as Buckingham Palace, the White House  or Government Houses of the British Empire and Commonwealth. The
hosts and any guests of honor form a receiving line  in order of precedence  near the entrance. Each guest is announced to the
host who greets each one in turn as he or she arrives. Each guest properly speaks little more than his name (if necessary) and a
conventional greeting or congratulation to each person in the receiving line. In this way, the line of guests progresses steadily
without unnecessary delay. After formally receiving each guest in this fashion, the hosts may mingle with the guests.

Somewhat less formal receptions are common in academic settings, sometimes to honor a guest lecturer, or to celebrate a special
occasion such as retirement of a respected member of staff. Receptions are also common in symposium  or academic conference 
settings, as an environment for attendees to mingle and interact informally. These gatherings may be accompanied by a sit-down
dinner, or more commonly, a stand-up informal buffet  meal.

Receptions are also held to celebrate exhibition openings  at art galleries  or museums. The featured artist or artists are often
present, as well as the curators  who organized the exhibition. In addition or instead, a celebratory reception may be held
partway through or at the end of an exhibition run. This alternative scheduling allows guests more time to see the exhibition in
depth at their own pace, before meeting the featured guests. Some food is often served, as in academic gatherings.

Refreshments at a reception may be as minimal, such as coffee or lemonade, or as elaborate as those at a state dinner.

DANCES AND BALLS

It may be a casual, informal affair or a structured event, such as a school dance  or a charity ball. Dances usually take place
during the evening. An afternoon dance is formally known as a tea dance. Some dances feature specific kinds of dancing, such as 
square dancing.

A ball  is a large formal party that features ballroom dancing. Women guests wear ball gowns; men wear evening dress.

BLOCK PARTY
Main articles: Block party  and Street partyA block party is a public party that is attended by the residents of a specific city
block or neighborhood. These parties are typically held in a city street that has been closed to traffic to accommodate the party.
At some block parties, attendees are free to pass from house to house, socializing, and often drinking alcoholic beverages.

COSTUME OR FANCY DRESS PARTY
At a masquerade ball, guests wear masks  to conceal their identities. Guests at a costume party  or a fancy dress party wear
costumes. These parties are sometimes associated with holiday events, such as Halloween  and Mardi Gras.

CHRISTMAS CAROLING PARTY
In English  and American  culture during the Christmas  season, it is traditional to have a Christmas caroling party. People go
from door to door in a neighborhood and sing Christmas carols. Some popular Christmas carols are "We Wish You a Merry Christmas",
"Deck the Halls", "The Twelve Days of Christmas", "Frosty the Snowman", "Jingle Bells", "Silver Bells", "Santa Claus Is Coming to
Town", and "O Holy Night".

In Spain, this type of party is called El Aguinaldo. It is the same as in England and the United States, but the only difference
is that the children who sing the carols are given tips.[3]  Christmas songs are called villancios  in Spain; they are mainly sung
by children at small parties.[4]

PARTIES FOR TEENAGERS AND YOUNG ADULTS
A dance party  supported by a live band  (SO36, Berlin)Dance parties  are gatherings in bars or community centers where the guests dance to house music, techno music, or disco. The
music for dance parties is usually selected and played by a disc jockey.

A spin-off of dance parties, the rave  involves dancing to loud house music, techno music, or industrial music. Rave parties may
be attended by as few as a score of people in a basement or, more likely, by a few hundred people in a club, to as many as
thousands in a large warehouse, field, or even tens of thousands in a sporting arena, amusement park, or other large space. Raves
are associated with illegal drugs such as Ecstasy  and psychedelic drugs.

A house party  is a party where a large group of people get together at a private home to socialize. House parties that involve
the drinking of beer pumped from a keg  are called keg parties or “keggers.” These parties are popular in North America, the 
United Kingdom, and Australia  and are often attended by people under the legal drinking age. Sometimes, even older party-goers
run afoul of the law for having provided alcoholic beverages  to minors. Arrests may also be made for violating a noise 
ordinance, for disorderly conduct,[5]  and even for operating a “blind pig”, an establishment that illegally sells alcoholic
beverages.

Outdoor parties include bush parties and beach parties. Bush parties (also called “field parties”) are held in a secluded area of
a forest (“bush”), where friends gather to drink  and talk. These parties are often held around a bonfire. Beach parties are held
on a sandy shoreline of a lake, river, or sea, and also often feature a bonfire.

A pool party is a party in which the guests swim in a swimming pool.

School-related parties for teenagers and young adults include proms  and graduation parties, which are held in honor of someone
who has recently graduated from a school or university.

SINGLES DANCE PARTY AND MIXER
A singles dance party and mixer is a party which is organized for people who are not married and who want to find a partner for 
friendship, dating, or sex.

Usually a “mixer game” is played, to make it easy for people to meet each other. For example, each guest may be given a card with
an inspiring quotation on it. The game is to find a potential partner who has the same quotation. Couples who have matching cards
may be given a small prize.

These parties are sponsored by various organizations, both non-profit and for-profit.

FUNDRAISING PARTY
A fundraising party, or fundraiser, is a party that is held for the purpose of collecting money that will be given to some person
or to some institution, such as a school, charity, business, or political campaign. These parties are usually formal and consist
of a dinner followed by speeches or by a presentation extolling whatever the money is being raised for.

It is very common to charge an admission fee for parties of this kind. This fee may be as high as several thousand dollars,
especially if money is being raised for a political campaign.

GRADUATION PARTY
In some places, parties to celebrate graduation from school, college or university are popular.

of this kind may also be held following the end of shooting for a motion picture  (called a “wrap party”) or after the season’s
final episode of a television series. Cast parties are traditionally held for most theater performances, both professional and
amateur.

Invited guests are usually restricted to performers, crew members, and a few others who did not participate in the performance,
such as sponsors and donors who have helped fund the production.

PRE-PARTY
A pre-party is a party that is held immediately before some event, such as a school dance, a wedding, a birthday party, or a bar
mitzvah. These parties are usually of short duration and sometimes involve getting ready for the event (e.g., the guests may put

A republic  (from Latin: res publica) is a sovereign state  or country[1]  which is organized with a form of government  in which
power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body[2][3]  and government leaders exercise power according to the 
rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic is commonly referred to a government which excludes a monarch.[3][4] 
Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states  use the word "republic" as part of their official names; not all of these are
republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word "republic" in their
names.

Both modern and ancient republics vary widely in their ideology and composition. In the classical and medieval  period of Europe,
many states were fashioned on the Roman Republic, which referred to the governance of the city of Rome, between it having kings
and emperors. The Italian medieval and Renaissance  political tradition, today referred to as "civic humanism", is sometimes
considered to derive directly from Roman republicans such as Sallust  and Tacitus. However, Greek-influenced Roman authors, such
as Polybius[5]  and Cicero, sometimes also used the term as a translation for the Greek politeia  which could mean regime
generally, but could also be applied to certain specific types of regime which did not exactly correspond to that of the Roman
Republic. Republics were not equated with classical democracies such as Athens, but had a democratic aspect.

Republics became more common in the Western world starting in the late 18th century, eventually displacing absolute monarchy  as
the most common form of government in Europe. In modern republics the executive is legitimized both by a constitution  and by
popular suffrage. In his work, "The Spirit of the Laws", Montesquieu  classified both democracies, where all the people have a
share in rule, and aristocracies, where only some of the people rule, as republican forms of government.[6]

Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as
republics, or which have governments that are described as 'republican' in nature. For instance, Article IV  of the United States
Constitution  "guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government".[7]  In contrast, the Soviet Union  was 
constitutionally  described as a "federal multinational state", composed of 15 republics, two of which – Ukraine  and Belarus  –
had their own seats at the United Nations.



ETYMOLOGY
The term originates as the Latin translation of Greek  word politeia. Cicero, among other Latin writers, translated politeia  as 
res publica  and it was in turn translated by Renaissance scholars as republic  (or similar terms in various western European
languages).[citation needed]

The term politeia  can be translated as form of government, polity, or regime, and is therefore not always a word for a specific
type of regime as the modern word republic is. (One of Plato's major works on political science was titled Politeia  and in
English it is thus known as The Republic. However, apart from the title, in modern translations of The Republic, alternative
translations of politeia  are also used.[8]) However, in Book III of his Politics  (1279a), Aristotle was apparently the first
classical writer to state that the term politeia  can be used to refer more specifically to one type of politeia: "When the
citizens at large govern for the public good, it is called by the name common to all governments (to koinon onoma pasōn tōn
politeiōn), government (politeia)". And also amongst classical Latin, the term "republic" can be used in a general way to refer to
any regime, or in a specific way to refer to governments which work for the public good.

In medieval Northern Italy, a number of city states had commune  or signoria  based governments. In the late Middle Ages, writers,
such as Giovanni Villani, began writing about the nature of these states and the differences from other types of regime. They used
terms such as libertas populi, a free people, to describe the states. The terminology changed in the 15th century as the renewed
interest in the writings of Ancient Rome  caused writers to prefer using classical terminology. To describe non-monarchical states
writers, most importantly Leonardo Bruni, adopted the Latin phrase res publica.[9]

While Bruni and Machiavelli  used the term to describe the states of Northern Italy, which were not monarchies, the term res
publica  has a set of interrelated meanings in the original Latin. The term can quite literally be translated as "public matter".
[10]  It was most often used by Roman writers to refer to the state and government, even during the period of the Roman Empire.
[11]

In subsequent centuries, the English word commonwealth  came to be used as a translation of res publica, and its use in English
was comparable to how the Romans used the term res publica.[12]  Notably, during The Protectorate  of Oliver Cromwell  the word 
commonwealth  was the most common term to call the new monarchless state, but the word republic  was also in common use.[13]

Presently, the term "republic" commonly means a system of government which derives its power from the people rather than from
another basis, such as heredity  or divine right.[citation needed]

HISTORY
While the philosophical terminology developed in classical Greece and Rome, as already noted by Aristotle there was already a long
history of city states with a wide variety of constitutions, not only in Greece but also in the Middle East. After the classical
period, during the Middle Ages, many free cities developed again, such as Venice.

CLASSICAL REPUBLICS
Main article: Classical republic
A map of the Roman RepublicThe modern type of "republic" itself is different from any type of state found in the classical world.[14][15]  Nevertheless,
there are a number of states of the classical era  that are today still called republics. This includes ancient Athens, Sparta 
and the Roman Republic. While the structure and governance of these states was very different from that of any modern republic,
there is debate about the extent to which classical, medieval, and modern republics form a historical continuum. J. G. A. Pocock 
has argued that a distinct republican tradition stretches from the classical world to the present.[10][16]  Other scholars
disagree.[10]  Paul Rahe, for instance, argues that the classical republics had a form of government with few links to those in
any modern country.[17]

The political philosophy of the classical republics have in any case had an influence on republican thought throughout the
subsequent centuries. Philosophers and politicians advocating for republics, such as Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Adams, and Madison,
relied heavily on classical Greek and Roman sources which described various types of regimes.

Aristotle's Politics  discusses various forms of government. One form Aristotle named politeia, which consisted of a mixture of
the other forms. He argued that this was one of the ideal forms of government. Polybius  expanded on many of these ideas, again
focusing on the idea of mixed government. The most important Roman work in this tradition is Cicero's De re publica.

Over time, the classical republics were either conquered by empires or became ones themselves. Most of the Greek republics were
annexed to the Macedonian Empire  of Alexander. The Roman Republic expanded dramatically conquering the other states of the
Mediterranean that could be considered republics, such as Carthage. The Roman Republic itself then became the Roman Empire.

OTHER ANCIENT REPUBLICS
Vaishali  was the capital  of the Vajjian Confederacy, an early republic.The term "republic" is not commonly used to refer to
pre-classical city states, especially if outside Europe and the area which was under Graeco-Roman influence.[10]  However some
early states outside Europe had governments that are sometimes today considered similar to republics.

In the ancient Near East, a number of cities of the Eastern Mediterranean  achieved collective rule. Arwad  has been cited as one
of the earliest known examples of a republic, in which the people, rather than a monarch, are described as sovereign.[18]  The 
Israelite  confederation of the era before the United Monarchy  has also been considered a type of republic.[10][19]  In Africa
the Axum Empire  was organized as a confederation ruled similarly to a royal republic.[20]  Similarly the Igbo  nation of what is
now Nigeria.[21]

The ancient Indian subcontinent  had a number of early republics known as Mahajanapadas.[22]  Mahajanapadas consisted of sixteen
oligarchic republics that existed during the sixth centuries BCE to fourth centuries BCE.[23][24]  Some Indian scholars, such as 
K.P. Jayaswal, have argued that a number of states in ancient India  had republican forms of government.[25][26][27]  There are no
surviving constitutions  or works of political philosophy  from this period in Indian history, but surviving religious texts  do
refer to a number of states having Gaṇa sangha, or council-based, as opposed to monarchical, governments.

ICELANDIC COMMONWEALTH
The Icelandic Commonwealth was established in 930 AD by refugees from Norway  who had fled the unification of that country under
King Harald Fairhair. The Commonwealth consisted of a number of clans run by chieftains, and the Althing was a combination of
parliament and supreme court where disputes appealed from lower courts were settled, laws were decided, and decisions of national
importance were taken. One such example was the Christianisation of Iceland  in 1000, where the Althing decreed, in order to
prevent an invasion, that all Icelanders must be baptized, and forbade celebration of pagan rituals. Contrary to most states, the
Icelandic Commonwealth had no official leader.

In the early 13th century, the Age of the Sturlungs, the Commonwealth began to suffer from long conflicts between warring clans.
This, combined with pressure from the Norwegian king Haakon IV  for the Icelanders to re-join the Norwegian "family", led the
Icelandic chieftains to accept Haakon IV as king by the signing of the Gamli sáttmáli  ("Old Covenant") in 1262. This effectively
brought the Commonwealth to an end. The Althing, however, is still Iceland's parliament, almost 800 years later.[28]

MERCANTILE REPUBLICS
Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Neptune  offers the wealth of the sea to Venice, 1748–50. This painting is an allegory of the power of
the Republic of Venice.In Europe new republics appeared in the late Middle Ages when a number of small states embraced republican
systems of government. These were generally small, but wealthy, trading states, like the Italian city-states  and the Hanseatic
League, in which the merchant class had risen to prominence. Knud Haakonssen has noted that, by the Renaissance, Europe was
divided with those states controlled by a landed elite being monarchies and those controlled by a commercial elite being
republics.[12]

Across Europe a wealthy merchant class developed in the important trading cities. Despite their wealth they had little power in
the feudal system  dominated by the rural land owners, and across Europe began to advocate for their own privileges and powers.
The more centralized states, such as France and England, granted limited city charters.

Beginning of the Republic of Metz. Election of the first Head-Alderman  in 1289, by Auguste Migette. Metz  was then a free
imperial city  of the Holy Roman Emperor.In the more loosely governed Holy Roman Empire, 51 of the largest towns became free imperial cities. While still under the
dominion of the Holy Roman Emperor  most power was held locally and many adopted republican forms of government.[29]  The same
rights to imperial immediacy were secured by the major trading cities of Switzerland. The towns and villages of alpine Switzerland 
 had, courtesy of geography, also been largely excluded from central control. Unlike Italy and Germany, much of the rural area was
thus not controlled by feudal barons, but by independent farmers who also used communal forms of government. When the Habsburgs 
tried to reassert control over the region both rural farmers and town merchants joined the rebellion. The Swiss  were victorious,
and the Swiss Confederacy  was proclaimed, and Switzerland has retained a republican form of government to the present.[19]

Italy was the most densely populated area of Europe, and also one with the weakest central government. Many of the towns thus
gained considerable independence and adopted commune forms of government. Completely free of feudal control, the Italian
city-states expanded, gaining control of the rural hinterland.[29]  The two most powerful were the Republic of Venice  and its
rival the Republic of Genoa. Each were large trading ports, and further expanded by using naval power to control large parts of
the Mediterranean. It was in Italy that an ideology advocating for republics first developed. Writers such as Bartholomew of Lucca
, Brunetto Latini, Marsilius of Padua, and Leonardo Bruni saw the medieval city-states as heirs to the legacy of Greece and Rome.

Two Russian cities with powerful merchant class—Novgorod  and Pskov—also adopted republican forms of government in 12th and 13th
centuries, respectively, which ended when the republics were conquered by Muscovy/Russia  at the end 15th – beginning of 16th
century.[30]

The dominant form of government for these early republics was control by a limited council of elite patricians. In those areas
that held elections, property qualifications or guild membership limited both who could vote and who could run. In many states no
direct elections were held and council members were hereditary or appointed by the existing council. This left the great majority
of the population without political power, and riots and revolts by the lower classes were common. The late Middle Ages saw more
than 200 such risings in the towns of the Holy Roman Empire.[31]  Similar revolts occurred in Italy, notably the Ciompi Revolt  in
Florence.

MERCANTILE REPUBLICS OUTSIDE OF EUROPE
Following the collapse of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum  and establishment of the Turkish  Anatolian Beyliks, the Ahiler  merchant
fraternities established a state centered on Ankara  that is sometimes compared to the Italian mercantile republics.

CALVINIST REPUBLICS
See also: European wars of religionWhile the classical writers had been the primary ideological source for the republics of Italy,
in Northern Europe, the Protestant Reformation  would be used as justification for establishing new republics.[32]  Most important
was Calvinist  theology, which developed in the Swiss Confederacy, one of the largest and most powerful of the medieval republics.
 John Calvin  did not call for the abolition of monarchy, but he advanced the doctrine that the faithful had the duty to overthrow
irreligious monarchs.[33]  Advocacy for republics appeared in the writings of the Huguenots  during the French Wars of Religion.
[34]

Calvinism played an important role in the republican revolts in England and the Netherlands. Like the city-states of Italy and the
Hanseatic League, both were important trading centres, with a large merchant class prospering from the trade with the New World.
Large parts of the population of both areas also embraced Calvinism. During the Dutch Revolt  (beginning in 1566), the Dutch
Republic  emerged from rejection of Spanish Habsburg  rule. However, the country did not adopt the republican form of government
immediately: in the formal declaration of independence (Act of Abjuration, 1581), the throne of king Philip  was only declared
vacant, and the Dutch magistrates asked the Duke of Anjou, queen Elizabeth of England  and prince William of Orange, one after
another, to replace Philip. It took until 1588 before the Estates  (the Staten, the representative assembly at the time) decided
to vest the sovereignty of the country in themselves.

In 1641 the English Civil War  began. Spearheaded by the Puritans  and funded by the merchants of London, the revolt was a
success, and King Charles I  was executed. In England James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, and John Milton  became some of the first
writers to argue for rejecting monarchy and embracing a republican form of government. The English Commonwealth  was short lived,
and the monarchy soon restored. The Dutch Republic continued in name until 1795, but by the mid-18th century the stadtholder  had
become a de facto  monarch. Calvinists were also some of the earliest settlers of the British and Dutch colonies of North America.

LIBERAL REPUBLICS
Liberal republics in early modern EuropeAn allegory of the Republic in Paris.Septinsular Republic  flag from the early 1800s.A

is not fit to be a king: Long live the Republic! The Reform! down with the Royal house, long live Aftonbladet! death to the king /
Republic Republic the People. Brunkeberg  this evening". The writer's identity is unknown.Along with these initial republican
revolts, early modern Europe  also saw a great increase in monarchial power. The era of absolute monarchy  replaced the limited
and decentralized monarchies that had existed in most of the Middle Ages. It also saw a reaction against the total control of the
monarch as a series of writers created the ideology known as liberalism.

Most of these Enlightenment  thinkers were far more interested in ideas of constitutional monarchy  than in republics. The
Cromwell regime had discredited republicanism, and most thinkers felt that republics ended in either anarchy  or tyranny.[35] 
Thus philosophers like Voltaire  opposed absolutism while at the same time being strongly pro-monarchy.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau  and Montesquieu  praised republics, and looked on the city-states of Greece as a model. However, both also
felt that a nation-state like France, with 20 million people, would be impossible to govern as a republic. Rousseau admired the
republican experiment in Corsica  (1755-1769) and described his ideal political structure of small self-governing communes.
Montesquieu felt that a city-state should ideally be a republic, but maintained that a limited monarchy was better suited to a
large nation.

The American Revolution  began as a rejection only of the authority of the British Parliament  over the colonies, not of the
monarchy. The failure of the British monarch to protect the colonies from what they considered the infringement of their rights
to
representative government, the monarch's branding of those requesting redress as traitors, and his support for sending combat
troops to demonstrate authority resulted in widespread perception of the British monarchy as tyrannical. With the United States
Declaration of Independence  the leaders of the revolt firmly rejected the monarchy and embraced republicanism. The leaders of the
revolution were well versed in the writings of the French liberal thinkers, and also in history of the classical republics. John
Adams had notably written a book on republics throughout history. In addition, the widely distributed and popularly read-aloud
tract Common Sense, by Thomas Paine, succinctly and eloquently laid out the case for republican ideals and independence to the
larger public. The Constitution of the United States, ratified in 1789, created a relatively strong federal republic  to replace
the relatively weak confederation  under the first attempt at a national government with the Articles of Confederation and
Perpetual Union  ratified in 1783. The first ten amendments to the Constitution, called the United States Bill of Rights,
guaranteed certain natural rights  fundamental to republican ideals that justified the Revolution.

The French Revolution  was also not republican at its outset. Only after the Flight to Varennes  removed most of the remaining
sympathy for the king was a republic declared and Louis XVI  sent to the guillotine. The stunning success of France in the French
Revolutionary Wars  saw republics spread by force of arms across much of Europe as a series of client republics  were set up
across the continent. The rise of Napoleon  saw the end of the French First Republic  and her Sister Republics, each replaced by '

popular monarchies'. Throughout the Napoleonic period, the victors extinguished many of the oldest republics on the continent,
including the Republic of Venice, the Republic of Genoa, and the Dutch Republic. They were eventually transformed into monarchies
or absorbed into neighbouring monarchies.

Outside Europe another group of republics was created as the Napoleonic Wars  allowed the states of Latin America to gain their
independence. Liberal ideology had only a limited impact on these new republics. The main impetus was the local European descended
 Creole  population in conflict with the Peninsulares  - governors sent from overseas. The majority of the population in most of
Latin America was of either African or Amerindian  descent, and the Creole elite had little interest in giving these groups power
and broad-based popular sovereignty. Simón Bolívar, both the main instigator of the revolts and one of its most important
theorists, was sympathetic to liberal ideals but felt that Latin America lacked the social cohesion for such a system to function
and advocated autocracy as necessary.

In Mexico this autocracy  briefly took the form of a monarchy in the First Mexican Empire. Due to the Peninsular War, the
Portuguese court was relocated to Brazil in 1808. Brazil gained independence  as a monarchy on September 7, 1822, and the Empire
of Brazil  lasted until 1889. In the other states various forms of autocratic republic existed until most were liberalized at the
end of the 20th century.[36]

French
Third Republic  was established in 1870, when a civil revolutionary committee refused to accept Napoleon III's surrender during
the Franco-Prussian War. Spain briefly became the First Spanish Republic  in 1873–4, but the monarchy was soon restored. By the
start of the 20th century France, Switzerland and San Marino remained the only republics in Europe. This changed when, after the
1908 Lisbon Regicide, the 5 October 1910 revolution  established the Portuguese Republic. This would encourage new republics
during and in the aftermath of World War I, when several of the largest European empires collapsed: the German Empire, 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, Russian Empire, and Ottoman Empire  were all replaced by republics. New states gained independence during
this turmoil, and many of these, such as Ireland, Poland, Finland  and Czechoslovakia, chose republican forms of government.
Following Greece's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22), the monarchy was briefly replaced by the Second Hellenic Republic 
(1924–1935). In 1931, the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic  (1931–1939) resulted in the Spanish Civil War  that would
be the prelude of World War II.

Republican ideas were spreading, especially in Asia. The United States began to have considerable influence in East Asia in the
later part of the 19th century, with Protestant  missionaries playing a central role. The liberal and republican writers of the
west also exerted influence. These combined with native Confucian  inspired political philosophy that had long argued that the
populace had the right to reject unjust government that had lost the Mandate of Heaven.

Two short-lived republics were proclaimed in East Asia, the Republic of Formosa  and the First Philippine Republic. China had seen
considerable anti-Qing sentiment, and a number of protest movements developed calling for constitutional monarchy. The most
important leader of these efforts was Sun Yat-sen, whose Three Principles of the People  combined American, European, and Chinese
ideas. The Republic of China  was proclaimed on January 1, 1912.

DECOLONIZATION
A map of the Commonwealth republicsIn the years following World War II, most of the remaining European colonies gained their
independence, and most became republics. The two largest colonial powers were France and the United Kingdom. Republican France
encouraged the establishment of republics in its former colonies. the United Kingdom attempted to follow the model it had for its
earlier settler colonies of creating independent Commonwealth realms  still linked under the same monarchy. While most of the
settler colonies and the smaller states of the Caribbean retained this system, it was rejected by the newly independent countries
in Africa and Asia, which revised their constitutions and became republics.

Britain followed a different model in the Middle East; it installed local monarchies in several colonies and mandates including 
Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen  and Libya. In subsequent decades revolutions and coups  overthrew a number of monarchs
and installed republics. Several monarchies remain, and the Middle East is the only part of the world where several large states
are ruled by monarchs with almost complete political control.[42]

SOCIALIST REPUBLICS
See also: People's Republic  and Socialist state
A poster that commemorates the permanent President of the Republic of China Yuan Shikai and the provisional President of the
RepublicIn the wake of the First World War, the Russian monarchy fell during the Russian Revolution. The Russian Provisional Government 
was established in its place on the lines of a liberal republic, but this was overthrown by the Bolsheviks  who went on to
establish the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This was the first republic established under Marxist-Leninist  ideology.
Communism was wholly opposed to monarchy, and became an important element of many republican movements during the 20th century.
The Russian Revolution spread into Mongolia, and overthrew its theocratic monarchy in 1924. In the aftermath of the Second World
War the communists gradually gained control of Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary  and Albania, ensuring that the states were
reestablished as socialist republics rather than monarchies.

Communism also intermingled with other ideologies. It was embraced by many national liberation movements during decolonization. In
Vietnam, communist republicans pushed aside the Nguyễn Dynasty, and monarchies in neighbouring Laos  and Cambodia  were overthrown
by communist movements in the 1970s. Arab socialism  contributed to a series of revolts and coups that saw the monarchies of Egypt
, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen ousted. In Africa Marxist-Leninism and African socialism  led to the end of monarchy and the proclamation
of republics in states such as Burundi  and Ethiopia.

ISLAMIC REPUBLICS
Main article: Islamic republicIslamic political philosophy has a long history of opposition to absolute monarchy, notably in the
work of Al-Farabi. Sharia law  took precedence over the will of the ruler, and electing rulers by means of the Shura  was an
important doctrine. While the early caliphate  maintained the principles of an elected ruler, later states became hereditary or
military dictatorships though many maintained some pretense of a consultative shura.

None of these states are typically referred to as republics. The current usage of republic in Muslim countries is borrowed from
the western meaning, adopted into the language in the late 19th century.[43]  The 20th century saw republicanism become an
important idea in much of the Middle East, as monarchies were removed in many states of the region. Iraq became a secular state.
Some nations, such as Indonesia  and Azerbaijan, began as secular. In Iran, the 1979 revolution  overthrew the monarchy and
created an Islamic republic  based on the ideas of Islamic democracy.

HEAD OF STATE
STRUCTURE
With no monarch, most modern republics use the title president  for the head of state. Originally used to refer to the presiding
officer of a committee or governing body in Great Britain the usage was also applied to political leaders, including the leaders
of some of the Thirteen Colonies  (originally Virginia in 1608); in full, the "President of the Council."[44]  The first republic
to adopt the title was the United States of America. Keeping its usage as the head of a committee the President of the
Continental
Congress  was the leader of the original congress. When the new constitution was written the title of President of the United
States  was conferred on the head of the new executive branch.

If the head of state of a republic is also the head of government, this is called a presidential system. There are a number of
forms of presidential government. A full-presidential system has a president with substantial authority and a central political
role.

In other states the legislature is dominant and the presidential role is almost purely ceremonial and apolitical, such as in
Germany and India. These states are parliamentary republics  and operate similarly to constitutional monarchies with 
parliamentary
systems  where the power of the monarch is also greatly circumscribed. In parliamentary systems the head of government, most often
titled prime minister, exercises the most real political power. Semi-presidential systems  have a president as an active head of
state, but also have a head of government with important powers.

The rules for appointing the president and the leader of the government, in some republics permit the appointment of a president
and a prime minister who have opposing political convictions: in France, when the members of the ruling cabinet  and the president
come from opposing political factions, this situation is called cohabitation.

In some countries, like Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina  and San Marino, the head of state is not a single person but a
committee (council) of several persons holding that office. The Roman Republic had two consuls, elected for a one year-term by the
 comitia centuriata, consisting of all adult, freeborn males who could prove citizenship.

ELECTIONS
In liberal democracies  presidents are elected, either directly by the people or indirectly by a parliament or council. Typically
in presidential and semi-presidential systems the president is directly elected by the people, or is indirectly elected as done in
the United States. In that country the president is officially elected by an electoral college, chosen by the States, all of which
do so by direct election of the electors. The indirect election of the president through the electoral college conforms to the
concept of republic as one with a system of indirect election. In the opinion of some, direct election confers legitimacy  upon
the president and gives the office much of its political power.[45]  However, this concept of legitimacy differs from that
expressed in the United States Constitution which established the legitimacy of the United States president as resulting from the
signing of the Constitution by nine states.[46]  The idea that direct election is required for legitimacy also contradicts the
spirit of the Great Compromise, whose actual result was manifest in the clause[47]  that provides voters in smaller states with
slightly more representation in presidential selection than those in large states.

In states with a parliamentary system the president is usually elected by the parliament. This indirect election subordinates the
president to the parliament, and also gives the president limited legitimacy and turns most presidential powers into reserve
powers  that can only be exercised under rare circumstance. There are exceptions where elected presidents have only ceremonial
powers, such as in Ireland.

AMBIGUITIES
The distinction between a republic and a monarchy is not always clear. The constitutional monarchies  of the former British Empire
and Western Europe today have almost all real political power vested in the elected representatives, with the monarchs only
holding either theoretical powers, no powers or rarely used reserve powers. Real legitimacy for political decisions comes from the
elected representatives and is derived from the will of the people. While hereditary monarchies remain in place, political power
is derived from the people as in a republic. These states are thus sometimes referred to as crowned republics.[48]

Terms such as liberal republic  are also used to describe all of the modern liberal democracies.[49]

There are also self-proclaimed republics that act similarly to monarchies with absolute power vested in the leader and passed down
from father to son. North Korea and Syria are two notable examples where a son has inherited political control. Neither of these
states are officially monarchies. There is no constitutional requirement that power be passed down within one family, but it has
occurred in practice.

There are also elective monarchies  where ultimate power is vested in a monarch, but the monarch is chosen by some manner of
election. A current example of such a state is Malaysia  where the Yang di-Pertuan Agong  is elected every five years by the 
Conference of Rulers  composed of the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states, and the Vatican City-State, where the pope  is
selected by cardinal-electors, currently all cardinals  under a specific age. While rare today, elective monarchs were common in
the past. The Holy Roman Empire is an important example, where each new emperor was chosen by a group of electors. Islamic states
also rarely employed primogeniture, instead relying on various forms of election to choose a monarch's successor.

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth  had an elective monarchy, with a wide suffrage of some 500,000 nobles. The system, known as
the Golden Liberty, had developed as a method for powerful landowners to control the crown. The proponents of this system looked
to classical examples, and the writings of the Italian Renaissance, and called their elective monarchy a rzeczpospolita, based on 
res publica.

SUB-NATIONAL REPUBLICS
This section does not cite  any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced
material may be challenged and removed.  (June 2015)  (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In general being a
republic also implies sovereignty  as for the state to be ruled by the people it cannot be controlled by a foreign power. There
are important exceptions to this, for example, republics in the Soviet Union  were member states which had to meet three criteria
to be named republics:

 1. be on the periphery of the Soviet Union so as to be able to take advantage of their theoretical right to secede;
 2. be economically strong enough to be self-sufficient upon secession; and
 3. be named after at least one million people of the ethnic group which should make up the majority population of said republic.

It is sometimes argued that the former Soviet Union was also a supra-national republic, based on the claim that the member states
were different nations.

Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia  (and earlier names) was a federal entity composed of six republics (Socialist
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia). Each republic had its parliament,
government, institute of citizenship, constitution, etc... but certain functions were delegated to the federation (army, monetary
matters). Each republic also had a right of self-determination according to the conclusions of the second session of the AVNOJ 
and according to the federal constitution.

States of the United States are required, like the federal government, to be republican in form, with final authority resting with
the people. This was required because the states were intended to create and enforce most domestic laws, with the exception of
areas delegated to the federal government and prohibited to the states. The founding fathers of the country intended most domestic
laws to be handled by the states. Requiring the states to be a republic in form was seen as protecting the citizens' rights and
preventing a state from becoming a dictatorship or monarchy, and reflected unwillingness on the part of the original 13 states
(all independent republics) to unite with other states that were not republics. Additionally, this requirement ensured that only
other republics could join the union.

In the example of the United States, the original 13 British colonies  became independent  states after the American Revolution,
each having a republican form of government. These independent states initially formed a loose confederation called the United
States and then later formed the current United States by ratifying the current U.S. Constitution, creating a union  of sovereign
states  with the union or federal  government also being a republic. Any state joining the union later was also required to be a
republic.

OTHER MEANINGS
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
Main article: RepublicanismThe term republic  originated from the writers of the Renaissance as a descriptive term for states that were not monarchies. These
writers, such as Machiavelli, also wrote important prescriptive works describing how such governments should function. These ideas
of how a government and society should be structured is the basis for an ideology known as classical republicanism  or civic
humanism. This ideology is based on the Roman Republic and the city states of Ancient Greece and focuses on ideals such as civic
virtue, rule of law, and mixed government.[50]

This understanding of a republic as a distinct form of government from a liberal democracy  is one of the main theses of the
Cambridge School of historical analysis.[51]  This grew out of the work of J. G. A. Pocock  who in 1975 argued that a series of
scholars had expressed a consistent set of republican ideals. These writers included Machiavelli, Milton, Montesquieu, and the
founders of the United States of America.

Pocock argued that this was an ideology with a history and principles distinct from liberalism.[52]  These ideas were embraced by
a number of different writers, including Quentin Skinner, Philip Pettit[53]  and Cass Sunstein. These subsequent writers have
further explored the history of the idea, and also outlined how a modern republic should function.

UNITED STATES
Main article: Republicanism in the United StatesA distinct set of definitions for the word republic  evolved in the United States. In common parlance, a republic is a state that
does not practice direct democracy  but rather has a government indirectly controlled by the people. This understanding of the
term was originally developed by James Madison, and notably employed in Federalist Paper No. 10. This meaning was widely adopted
early in the history of the United States, including in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828. It was a novel meaning to the term;
representative democracy was not an idea mentioned by Machiavelli and did not exist in the classical republics.[54]  Also, there
is evidence that contemporaries of Madison considered the meaning of the word to reflect the definition found elsewhere, as is the
case with a quotation of Benjamin Franklin  taken from the notes of James McHenry  where the question is put forth, "a Republic or
a Monarchy?"[55]

The term republic  does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, but does appear in Article IV of the Constitution which
"guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government." What exactly the writers of the constitution felt
this should mean is uncertain. The Supreme Court, in Luther v. Borden  (1849), declared that the definition of republic  was a "
political question" in which it would not intervene. In two later cases, it did establish a basic definition. In United States v.
Cruikshank  (1875), the court ruled that the "equal rights of citizens" were inherent to the idea of a republic.

However, the term republic  is not synonymous with the republican form. The republican form is defined as one in which the powers
of sovereignty are vested in the people and are exercised by the people, either directly, or through representatives chosen by the
people, to whom those powers are specially delegated. In re Duncan, 139 U.S. 449, 11 S.Ct. 573, 35 L.Ed. 219; Minor v. Happersett,
88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162, 22 L.Ed. 627. [56]

Beyond these basic definitions the word republic  has a number of other connotations. W. Paul Adams observes that republic  is
most often used in the United States as a synonym for state or government, but with more positive connotations than either of
those terms.[57]  Republicanism is often referred to as the founding ideology of the United States. Traditionally scholars
believed this American republicanism was a derivation of the classical liberal ideologies of John Locke  and others developed in
Europe.

A political philosophy of republicanism that formed during the Renaissance period, and initiated by Machiavelli, was thought to
have had little impact on the founders of the United States. In the 1960s and 1970s a revisionist school[citation needed]  led by
the likes of Bernard Bailyn  began to argue that republicanism was just as or even more important than liberalism in the creation
of the United States.[58]  This issue is still much disputed and scholars like Isaac Kramnick  completely reject this view.[59]

Map showing the countries of the world.A country  is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent 
sovereign state  or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign  or formerly sovereign political division, or a
geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people  with distinct political
characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the 
League of Nations  in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations  in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent
exercise of legal jurisdiction.

Sometimes the word countries  is used to refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,[1][2]  while other times
it refers only to states.[3]  For example, the CIA World Factbook  uses the word in its "Country name" field to refer to "a wide
variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities in addition to the traditional
countries or independent states".[4][Note 1]



ETYMOLOGY AND USAGE
The word country  comes from Old French  cuntrée, itself derived from Vulgar Latin  (terra) contrata  (“(land) lying opposite;
(land) spread before”), derived from contra  (“against, opposite”). It most likely entered the English language after the 
Franco-Norman invasion  during the 11th century.

In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the 
indefinite
article  – "a country" – through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a synonym  for state, or a former sovereign state, in the
sense of sovereign territory or "district, native land".[5]  Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such
as the West Country  in England, the Black Country  (a heavily industrialized part of England), "Constable Country" (a part of 
East Anglia  painted by John Constable), the "big country" (used in various contexts of the American West), "coal country" (used
of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.[6]

The equivalent terms in French and other Romance languages  (pays  and variants) have not carried the process of being identified
with political sovereign states as far as the English "country", instead derived from, pagus, which designated the territory
controlled by a medieval count, a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for
sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the German Bundesländer, as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state.
France has very many "pays" that are officially recognised at some level, and are either natural regions, like the Pays de Bray,
or reflect old political or economic entities, like the Pays de la Loire.

A version of "country" can be found in the modern French language  as contrée, based on the word cuntrée  in Old French,[6]  that
is used similarly to the word "pays" to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some
particular cases. The modern Italian contrada  is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a ward  or similar
small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.

SOVEREIGNTY STATUS
See also: List of sovereign statesThe term "country" is frequently used to refer to sovereign states. There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries"
in the world, since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status. There are 206 sovereign states, with 193 states
participating in the United Nations, two observer states (the Holy See  and Palestine), and 11 other states. All are defined as
states by declarative theory of statehood  and constitutive theory of statehood. The latest proclaimed state is South Sudan.

Although not sovereign states, England, Scotland, Wales  and Northern Ireland  can be referred to as separate countries, which
collectively form the sovereign state known as the United Kingdom.[7][8][9][10]  The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries
varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas dependencies  (such as the British
Virgin
Islands  in UK  and Saint Pierre and Miquelon  in France), with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own.
Such dependent territories are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries, but may nonetheless be treated
as a separate "country of origin" in international trade, as Hong Kong  is.[11][12][13]

A council may function as a 
legislature, especially at a town, city  or county  level, but most legislative bodies at the state or national level are not
considered councils. At such levels, there may be no separate executive branch, and the council may effectively represent the
entire government. A board of directors  might also be denoted as a council. A committee  might also be denoted as a council,
though a committee is generally a subordinate body composed of members of a larger body, while a council may not be. Because many
schools have a student council, the council is the form of governance with which many people are likely to have their first
experience as electors or participants.

A member of a council may be referred to as a councillor  or councilperson, or by the gender-specific titles of councilman  and 
councilwoman.

Structure of the United Nations.An organization  or organisation  (see spelling differences) is an entity  comprising multiple people, such as an institution  or
an association, that has a collective goal and is linked to an external environment[citation needed].

The word is derived from the Greek word organon, which means "organ".



TYPES
There are a variety of legal types of organizations, including corporations, governments, non-governmental organizations, 
political organizations, international organizations, armed forces, charities, not-for-profit corporations, partnerships, 
cooperatives, and educational institutions.

A hybrid organization  is a body that operates in both the public sector  and the private sector  simultaneously, fulfilling
public duties and developing commercial market activities.

A voluntary association  is an organization consisting of volunteers. Such organizations may be able to operate without legal
formalities, depending on jurisdiction, including informal clubs.

Organizations may also operate in secret and/or illegally in the case of secret societies, criminal organizations  and resistance
movements.

STRUCTURES
Diagram of the Federal Government and American Union, 1864.Main article: Organizational structureThe study of organizations
includes a focus on optimizing organizational structure. According to management science, most human  organizations fall roughly
into four types:

 * Committees  or juries
 * Ecologies
 * Matrix  organizations
 * Pyramids  or hierarchies

COMMITTEES OR JURIES
These consist of a group of peers who decide as a group, perhaps by voting. The difference between a jury  and a committee  is
that the members of the committee are usually assigned to perform or lead further actions after the group comes to a decision,
whereas members of a jury come to a decision. In common law  countries, legal juries render decisions of guilt, liability and
quantify damages; juries are also used in athletic contests, book awards and similar activities. Sometimes a selection committee
functions like a jury. In the Middle Ages, juries in continental Europe were used to determine the law according to consensus
among local notables.

Committees are often the most reliable way to make decisions. Condorcet's jury theorem  proved that if the average member votes
better than a roll of dice, then adding more members increases the number of majorities that can come to a correct vote (however
correctness is defined). The problem is that if the average member is subsequently worse  than a roll of dice, the committee's
decisions grow worse, not better; therefore, staffing is crucial.

Parliamentary  procedure, such as Robert's Rules of Order, helps prevent committees from engaging in lengthy discussions without
reaching decisions.

ECOLOGIES
This organization has intense competition. Bad parts of the organization starve. Good ones get more work. Everybody is paid for
what they actually do, and runs a tiny business that has to show a profit, or they are fired.

Companies who utilize this organization type reflect a rather one-sided view of what goes on in ecology. It is also the case that
a natural ecosystem  has a natural border - ecoregions  do not in general compete with one another in any way, but are very
autonomous.

The pharmaceutical company  GlaxoSmithKline  talks about functioning as this type of organization in this external article  from 
The Guardian. By:Bastian Batac De Leon.

MATRIX ORGANIZATION
See also: Matrix managementThis organizational type assigns each worker two bosses in two different hierarchies. One hierarchy is
"functional" and assures that each type of expert in the organization is well-trained, and measured by a boss who is super-expert
in the same field. The other direction is "executive" and tries to get projects completed using the experts. Projects might be
organized by products, regions, customer types, or some other schema.

As an example, a company might have an individual with overall responsibility for products X and Y, and another individual with
overall responsibility for engineering, quality control, etc. Therefore, subordinates responsible for quality control of project X
will have two reporting lines.

PYRAMIDS OR HIERARCHICAL
A hierarchy  exemplifies an arrangement with a leader  who leads other individual members of the organization. This arrangement is
often associated with basis that there are enough imagine a real pyramid, if there are not enough stone blocks to hold up the
higher ones, gravity would irrevocably bring down the monumental structure. So one can imagine that if the leader does not have
the support of his subordinates, the entire structure will collapse. Hierarchies were satirized  in The Peter Principle  (1969), a
book that introduced hierarchiology  and the saying that "in a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of
incompetence."

THEORIES
See also: Organizational theoryIn the social sciences, organizations are the object of analysis for a number of disciplines, such
as sociology, economics,[1]  political science, psychology, management, and organizational communication. The broader analysis of
organizations is commonly referred to as organizational structure, organizational studies, organizational behavior, or
organization analysis. A number of different perspectives exist, some of which are compatible:

 * From a functional perspective, the focus is on how entities like businesses or state authorities are used.
 * From an institutional perspective, an organization is viewed as a purposeful structure within a social context.
 * From a process-related perspective, an organization is viewed as an entity is being (re-)organized, and the focus is on the
   organization as a set of tasks or actions.

Sociology can be defined as the science of the institutions  of modernity; specific institutions serve a function, akin to the
individual organs of a coherent body. In the social and political sciences in general, an "organization" may be more loosely
understood as the planned, coordinated and purposeful action of human beings working through collective action to reach a common
goal or construct a tangible product. This action is usually framed by formal membership and form (institutional rules). Sociology
distinguishes the term organization into planned formal and unplanned informal (i.e. spontaneously formed) organizations.
Sociology analyzes organizations in the first line from an institutional perspective. In this sense, organization is an enduring
arrangement of elements. These elements and their actions are determined by rules so that a certain task can be fulfilled through
a system of coordinated division of labor.

Economic approaches to organizations also take the division of labor  as a starting point. The division of labor allows for
(economies of) specialization. Increasing specialization necessitates coordination. From an economic point of view, markets and
organizations are alternative coordination mechanisms for the execution of transactions.[1]

An organization is defined by the elements that are part of it (who belongs to the organization and who does not?), its 
communication  (which elements communicate and how do they communicate?), its autonomy (which changes are executed autonomously by
the organization or its elements?), and its rules of action compared to outside events (what causes an organization to act as a
collective actor?).

By coordinated and planned cooperation of the elements, the organization is able to solve tasks that lie beyond the abilities of
the single elements. The price paid by the elements is the limitation of the degrees of freedom  of the elements. Advantages of
organizations are enhancement (more of the same), addition (combination of different features) and extension. Disadvantages can be
inertness (through co-ordination) and loss of interaction.

Among the theories that are or have been influential are:

 * Activity theory  is the major theoretical influence, acknowledged by de Clodomir Santos de Morais  in the development of 
   Organization Workshop  method.
 * Actor–network theory, an approach to social theory and research, originating in the field of science studies, which treats
   objects as part of social networks.
 * Complexity theory and organizations, the use of complexity theory  in the field of strategic management  and organizational
   studies.
 * Contingency theory, a class of behavioral theory that claims that there is no best way to organize a corporation, to lead a
   company, or to make decisions.
 * Critical management studies, a loose but extensive grouping of theoretically informed critiques of management, business, and
   organization, grounded originally in a critical theory  perspective
 * Economic sociology, studies both the social effects and the social causes of various economic phenomena.
 * Enterprise architecture, the conceptual model that defines the coalescence of organizational structure and organizational
   behavior.
 * Garbage Can Model, describes a model which disconnects problems, solutions and decision makers from each other.
 * Principal–agent problem, concerns the difficulties in motivating one party (the "agent"), to act in the best interests of
   another (the "principal") rather than in his or her own interests
 * Scientific management  (mainly following Frederick W. Taylor), a theory of management  that analyzes and synthesizes workflows.
 * Social entrepreneurship, the process of pursuing innovative solutions to social problems.
 * Transaction cost theory, the idea that people begin to organize their production in firms when the transaction cost of
   coordinating production through the market exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than within the firm.
 * Weber's Ideal of Bureaucracy  (refer to Max Weber's chapter on "Bureaucracy" in his book Economy and Society)

LEADERSHIP
Main article: LeadershipA leader  in a formal, hierarchical organization, who is appointed to a managerial position, has the right to command and enforce
obedience by virtue of the authority of his position. However, he must possess adequate personal attributes to match his
authority, because authority is only potentially available to him. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may
be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However,
only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can
legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.[2]

FORMAL ORGANIZATIONS
An organization that is established as a means for achieving defined objectives  has been referred to as a formal organization.
Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections,
positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work structure. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard
to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit
or seniority. Each employee receives a salary and enjoys a degree of tenure that safeguards him from the arbitrary influence of
superiors or of powerful clients. The higher his position in the hierarchy, the greater his presumed expertise in adjudicating
problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic
structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and
endows them with the authority attached to their position.[3]

INFORMAL ORGANIZATIONS
In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the informal
organization  that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal objectives  and goals  of the
individual membership. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal
organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life – the spontaneous emergence
of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.[3]

In prehistoric times, man was preoccupied with his personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now man spends a
major portion of his waking hours working for organizations. His need to identify with a community that provides security,
protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging continues unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal
organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.[2]

Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization. Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or
a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures.
Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence
is the ability of a person to gain cooperation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger
form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.[2]

Authority control * GND: 4043774-7For other uses, see International (disambiguation).International  mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country. The term
international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond
national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country  and usually everywhere on Earth,
and international language  which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country.



ORIGIN OF THE WORD
The term international  was coined by the utilitarian  philosopher Jeremy Bentham  in his Introduction to Principles of Morals
and
Legislation, which was printed for publication in 1780 and published in 1789. Bentham wrote: "The word international, it must be
acknowledged, is a new one; though, it is hoped, sufficiently analogous and intelligible. It is calculated to express, in a more
significant way, the branch of law which goes commonly under the name of the law of nations.[1]  The word was adopted in French in
1801.[2]  Thomas Erskine Holland  noted in his article on Bentham in the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica  that "Many
of Bentham's phrases, such as 'international,' 'utilitarian,' 'codification,' are valuable additions to our language; but the
majority of them, especially those of Greek derivation, have taken no root in it."

MEANING IN PARTICULAR FIELDS
 * In team sports, "international" is a match  between two national teams, or two players capped  by a national team.
 * In politics, "The International" may refer to a political international.
 * In law, "international" may refer to several disciplines of International law  like public international law, international
   criminal law  etc.
 * In linguistics, an international language is one spoken by the people of more than one nation, usually by many. Also called 
   world language. English, Spanish, French  and Arabic  are considered to be world languages.[3]
 * In interlinguistics, international often has to do with languages rather than nations themselves. An "international word" is
   one that occurs in more than one language. These words are collected from widely spoken source or control languages, and often
   used to establish language systems that people can use to communicate internationally, and sometimes for other purposes such as
   to learn other languages more quickly. The vocabulary of Interlingua  has a particularly wide range, because the control
   languages  of Interlingua were selected to give its words and affixes their maximum geographic scope.[4]  In part, the language
    Ido  is also a product of interlinguistic research.
 * In arts, an international art movement  is an art movement with artists from more than one country, usually by many. Some
   international art movements are Letterist International, Situationist International, Stuckism International.

"International" is also sometimes used as a synonym for "global".
