A compass rose  with west highlightedWest  is one of the four cardinal directions  or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from east.



ETYMOLOGY
The word "West" is a Germanic  word passed into some Romance languages (ouest  in French, oest  in Catalan, ovest  in Italian, 
oeste  in Spanish and Portuguese). As is apparent in the Gothic term vasi  (Visigoths), it stems from the same Indo-European root
that gave the Sanskrit vas-ati  (night) and vesper  (evening) in Latin.

NAVIGATION
To go west using a compass for navigation, one needs to set a bearing  or azimuth  of 270Â°.

West is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the 
Sun  appears to constantly progress and eventually set.

Moving continuously west is following a circle of latitude.

CULTURAL
The phrase "the West" is often spoken in reference to the Western world, which includes the European Union  (also the EFTA 
countries), the Americas, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and (in part) South Africa.

The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the Western Roman Empire  and the Western Christianity. During the 
Cold War  "the West" was often used to refer to the NATO  camp as opposed to the Warsaw Pact  and non-aligned nations. The
expression survives, with an increasingly ambiguous meaning.

SYMBOLIC MEANINGS
In Chinese Buddhism, the West represents movement toward the Buddha  or enlightenment (see Journey to the West). The ancient 
Aztecs  believed that the West was the realm of the great goddess of water, mist, and maize. In Ancient Egypt, the West was
considered to be the portal to the netherworld, and is the cardinal direction regarded in connection with death, though not always
with a negative connotation. Ancient Egyptians also believed that the Goddess  Amunet  was a personification of the West.[1]  The 
Celts  believed that beyond the western sea off the edges of all maps lay the Otherworld, or Afterlife.

In Judaism, west is seen to be toward the Shekinah  (presence) of God, as in Jewish history the Tabernacle  and subsequent 
Jerusalem Temple  faced east, with God's Presence in the Holy of Holies  up the steps to the west. According to the Bible, the 
Israelites  crossed the Jordan River  westward into the Promised Land. In Islam, while in India, people pray facing towards the
west as in respect to India, Mecca  is in the West-ward direction.

In American literature  (e.g. in The Great Gatsby) moving West has sometimes symbolized gaining freedom, perhaps as an association
with the settling of the Old West  (see also Manifest Destiny).
