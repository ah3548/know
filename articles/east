ETYMOLOGY
The word east  comes from Middle English  est, from Old English  ēast, which itself comes from the Proto-Germanic  *aus-to-  or *
austra-  "east, toward the sunrise", from Proto-Indo-European  *aus- "to shine," or "dawn".[1]  This is similar to Old High German 
 *ōstar  "to the east", Latin  aurora  "dawn", and Greek  ēōs  or heōs.[2]  Ēostre, a Germanic goddess  of dawn, might have been a
personification of both dawn and the cardinal points.

NAVIGATION
By convention, the right hand side of a map  is east. This convention has developed from the use of a compass, which places north
at the top.

To go east using a compass for navigation, one sets a bearing  or azimuth  of 90°.

CULTURAL
East is the direction toward which the Earth  rotates about its axis, and therefore the general direction from which the Sun 
appears to rise. The practice of praying towards the East is older than Christianity, but has been adopted by this religion as the
Orient was thought of as containing mankind's original home. Hence, some Christian churches have been traditionally oriented
towards the east.[3][4]
