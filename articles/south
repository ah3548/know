For other uses, see South (disambiguation).
A 16-point compass rose  with south at the bottom.South  is a noun, adjective, or adverb  indicating direction  or geography. It is one of the four cardinal directions  or compass
points. South is the polar opposite of north  and is perpendicular  to east  and west.



ETYMOLOGY
The word south  comes from Old English  sūþ, from earlier Proto-Germanic  *sunþaz  ("south"), possibly related to the same 
Proto-Indo-European  root that the word sun  derived from.

NAVIGATION
By convention, the bottom side of a map  is south, although reversed maps  exist that defy this convention.[1]  To go south using
a compass for navigation, set a bearing  or azimuth  of 180°. Alternatively, in the Northern Hemisphere  outside the tropics, the 
Sun  will be roughly in the south at midday.[2]

SOUTH POLE
True south is the direction towards the southern end of the axis about which the earth  rotates, called the South Pole. The South
Pole is located in Antarctica. Magnetic south  is the direction towards the south magnetic pole, some distance away from the south
geographic pole.[3]

Roald Amundsen, from Norway, was the first to reach the South Pole, on 14 December 1911, after Ernest Shackleton  from the UK  was
forced to turn back some distance short.[4]

GEOGRAPHY
The Global South  refers to the socially and economically less-developed southern half of the globe. 95% of the Global North has
enough food and shelter, and a functioning education system.[5]  In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has
enough food and shelter. It "lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and
their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports."[5]

Use of the term 'South' may also be country-relative, particularly in cases of noticeable economic or cultural divide - for
example the Southern United States, separated from the Northeastern United States  by the Mason–Dixon line, or the South of
England, which is politically and economically unmatched with all of the North of England.

OTHER USES
In the card game bridge, one of the players is known for scoring purposes as South. South partners with North and plays against
East and West.[6]

In Greek religion, Notos, was the south wind and bringer of the storms of late summer and autumn.
