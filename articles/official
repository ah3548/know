For other uses, see Official (disambiguation).Ambtenaar  (government official), by Louis DuséeAn official'  is someone who holds an office (function or mandate, regardless whether it carries an actual working space  with it)
in an organization  or government  and participates in the exercise of authority  (either their own or that of their superior
and/or employer, public or legally private).

A government official  or functionary  is an official who is involved in public administration  or government, through either 
election, appointment, selection, or employment. A bureaucrat  or civil servant  is a member of the bureaucracy. An elected
official  is a person who is an official by virtue of an election. Officials may also be appointed ex officio  (by virtue of
another office, often in a specified capacity, such as presiding, advisory, secretary). Some official positions may be inherited.
A person who currently holds an office is referred to as an incumbent.

The word official  as a noun  has been recorded since the Middle English  period, first seen in 1314.[citation needed]  It comes
from the Old French  official  (12th century), from the Latin  officialis  ("attendant to a magistrate, public official"), the
noun use of the original adjective  officialis  ("of or belonging to duty, service, or office") from officium  ("office"). The
meaning "person in charge of some public work or duty" was first recorded in 1555. The adjective is first attested in English in
1533 via the Old French oficial.

The informal term officialese, the jargon  of "officialdom", was first recorded in 1884.



ROMAN ANTIQUITY
An officialis  (plural officiales) was the official term (somewhat comparable to a modern civil servant) for any member of the 
officium  (staff) of a high dignitary such as a governor.

In Canon law, the word or its Latin original officialis  is used absolutely as the legal title of a diocesan bishop's judicial
vicar  who shares the bishop's ordinary  judicial power over the diocese and presides over the diocesan ecclesiastical court.

The 1983 Code of Canon Law gives precedence to the title Judicial Vicar, rather than that of Officialis (canon 420). The Code of
Canons of the Eastern Churches uses only the title Judicial Vicar (canon 191).

In German, the related noun Offizialat  was also used for an official bureau in a diocese that did much of its administration,
comprising the vicariate-general, an adjoined secretariat, a registry office and a chancery.

The title of official principal, together with that of vicar-general, has in Anglicanism been merged in that of Diocesan
chancellor  of a diocese.

OTHER
In sports, the term official is used to describe a person enforcing playing rules  in the capacity of a linesman, referee  and 
umpire; also specified by the discipline, e.g. American football official, Ice hockey official.

The term officer  is close to being a synonym (but has more military connotations). A functionary  is someone who carries out a
particular role within an organization; this again is quite a close synonym for official, as a noun, but with connotations closer
to bureaucrat. Any such person acts in their official capacity, in carrying out the duties of their office; they are also said to 
officiate, for example in a ceremony. A public official  is an official of central or local government.

MAX WEBER ON BUREAUCRATIC OFFICIALS
Max Weber  gave as definition of a bureaucratic official:

 * he is personally free and appointed to his position on the basis of conduct
 * he exercises the authority delegated to him in accordance with impersonal rules, and his loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the
   faithful execution of his official duties
 * his appointment and job placement are dependent upon his technical qualifications
 * his administrative work is a full-time occupation
 * his work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career.

An official must exercise his judgment and his skills, but his duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority;
ultimately he is responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice his personal judgment if it
runs counter to his official duties.

ADJECTIVE
As an adjective, "official" often, but not always, means pertaining to the government, either as state employee or having state
recognition, or to analogous governance, or to formal (especially legally regulated) proceeding as opposed to informal business.
Some examples:

 * An official holiday  is a public holiday, having national (or regional) recognition.
 * An official language  is a language recognised by a government, for its own use in administration, or for delivering services
   to its citizens (for example, on signposts).
 * An official spokesperson  is an individual empowered to speak for the government, or some part of it such as a ministry, on a
   range of issues and on the record for the media.
 * An official statement  is an issued by an organisation as an expression of its corporate position or opinion;[citation needed] 
   an official apology  is an apology similarly issued by an organisation (as opposed to an apology by an individual).[citation
   needed]
 * Official policy  is policy publicly acknowledged and defended by an organisation.[citation needed]  In these cases unofficial 
   is an antonym, and variously may mean informal, unrecognised, personal or unacknowledged.
 * An official strike  is a strike  organised and recognised by a labour union, as opposed to an unofficial strike  at grassroots
   level.
 * An official school  is a school  administered by the government or by a local authority, as opposite to a private school  or 
   religious school.[citation needed]
 * An official history, for example of an institution or business, or particularly of a war  or military unit, is a history
   written as a commission, with the assumption of co-operation with access to records and archives; but without necessarily full 
   editorial independence.[citation needed]
 * An official biography  is usually on the same lines, written with access to private papers and the support of the family of the
   subject.[citation needed]
