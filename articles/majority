This article is about the mathematical concept of majority and its applications. For other uses, see Majority (disambiguation).
Look up majority  in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.A majority  is the greater part, or more than half, of the total. It is a subset  of a set  consisting of more than half of the
set's elements.

"Majority" can be used to specify the voting requirement, as in a "majority vote". A majority vote is more than half of the votes
cast.

A majority can be compared to a plurality, which is a subset larger than any other subset considered. A plurality is not
necessarily a majority as the largest subset considered may consist of less than half the set's elements. This can occur when
there are three or more possible choices.

In British English the term majority is also alternatively used to refer to the winning margin, i.e. the number of votes
separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher.

Other related terms containing the word "majority" have their own meanings, which may sometimes be inconsistent in usage.



EXPLANATION
A majority is the greater part, or more than half, of the total.[1]  For example, say a group consists of 20 individuals. In this
case, a majority would be 11 or more individuals. For this group, having 10 or fewer individuals would not constitute a majority.

MAJORITY VOTE
In parliamentary procedure, the term "majority" simply means "more than half."[2]  As it relates to a vote, a majority vote is
more than half of the votes cast.[3]  Abstentions  or blanks are excluded in calculating a majority vote.[4]  Also, the totals do
not include votes cast by someone not entitled to vote or improper multiple votes by a single member.[5]

Depending on the parliamentary authority  used, there may be a difference in the total that is used to calculate a majority vote
due to "illegal votes". Illegal votes are votes which are cast for unidentifiable or ineligible candidates or choices.[5]  In this
definition, "illegal" refers to the choices made on the ballot and does not refer to the persons who cast the votes (i.e. the
persons are eligible to vote).

In Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised  (abbreviated RONR), illegal votes are counted as votes cast, but are not credited to any
candidate.[5]

In The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure  (abbreviated TSC), illegal votes are not included in the total and a majority
vote is defined as being more than half of all eligible votes cast.[6]

The issue of "illegal votes" does not exist when only two options are possible (e.g. "yes" or "no"), such as when a majority vote
is required to adopt a proposal (motion). In this context, a majority vote is more "yes" votes than "no" votes.[7]

A majority vote is not the same as a vote of a "majority of the members present" or a vote of a "majority of the entire membership
".

EXAMPLES
For example, assume that votes are cast for three people for an office: Alice, Bob, and Carol.

SCENARIO 1
CandidateVotesAlice14Bob4Carol2Total20In Scenario 1, Alice received a majority vote. There were 20 votes cast and Alice received
more than half of them.

SCENARIO 2
CandidateVotesAlice10Bob6Carol4Total20In Scenario 2, assume all three candidates are eligible. In this case, no one received a
majority vote. This example also illustrates that half the votes cast is not a majority vote.

SCENARIO 3
CandidateVotesAlice10Bob6Carol (ineligible)4Total20In Scenario 3, assume that Alice and Bob are eligible candidates, but Carol is
not. Using Robert's Rules of Order, no one received a majority vote, which is the same as Scenario 2. In this case, the 4 votes
for Carol are counted in the total, but are not credited to Carol (which precludes the possibility of an ineligible candidate
being credited with receiving a majority vote).

However, using The Standard Code, Alice received a majority vote since only votes for eligible candidates are counted using this
book. In this case, there are 16 votes for eligible candidates and Alice received more than half of those 16 votes.

COMPARISON TO PLURALITY
In all three scenarios, Alice received a plurality, or the most votes among the candidates.[8]  However, only in Scenario 1 did
Alice receive a majority vote using Robert's Rules of Order.

RELATED TERMS
Other related terms containing the word "majority" have their own meanings, which may sometimes be inconsistent in usage.[9]

A majority may sometimes be called a "simple majority" to contrast with other terms using "majority".[9]  A "simple majority" may
also mean a "relative majority", or a plurality.[10]  These two definitions would conflict when a "simple majority" (i.e.
plurality) is not a "majority" (also see the disambiguation page for simple majority).

An "absolute majority" may mean a majority of all  electors, not just those who voted.[9][11]  This usage would be equivalent to a
"majority of the entire membership". However, the definition for "absolute majority" is not consistent, as it could also mean the
same as "majority" or "simple majority".[9][12][13][14]  The meanings for "absolute majority" and "simple majority" would have to
be determined from the context in which these terms are used.

A "supermajority", or a "qualified majority", is a specified higher threshold than one half.[9]  A common use of a supermajority
is a "two-thirds vote", which is sometimes referred to as a "two-thirds majority".

In parliamentary systems, an "overall majority" is the difference of legislators between the government and its opposition.[15] 
In this context, the term "majority" could be also alternatively used to refer to the winning margin, i.e. the number of votes
separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher.[1][15]

A "double majority" is a voting system which requires a majority of votes according to two separate criteria.[9]

TEMPORARY MAJORITY
A temporary majority exists when the positions of the members present and voting in a meeting of a deliberative assembly on a
subject are not representative of the membership as a whole. Parliamentary procedure contains some provisions designed to protect
against a temporary majority violating the rights of absentees. For instance, previous notice  is required to rescind, repeal or
annul  or amend something previously adopted by a majority vote; if previous notice has not been given, a two-thirds vote is
required.[16]  However, in this and many other cases, previous notice is not required if a majority of the entire membership votes
in favor, because that indicates that it is clearly not a temporary majority. Another protection against a decision being made by
a temporary majority is the motion to reconsider and enter on the minutes, by which two members can suspend action on a measure
until it is called up at a meeting on another day.[17]

APPLICATION IN OTHER VOTING REQUIREMENTS
"Majority" could be specified with respect to the voting body.

"MAJORITY OF THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP" AND "MAJORITY OF THE FIXED MEMBERSHIP"
A "majority of the entire membership" means more than half of all the members of a body.[18]  A "majority of the fixed membership"
means more than half of all the seats of a body.[18]  A majority of the entire membership is different from a majority of the
fixed membership when there are vacancies.[18]

For example, say a board  has 12 seats. If the board has the maximum number of members, or 12 members, a majority of the entire
membership and a majority of the fixed membership would be 7 members. However, if there are two vacancies (so that there are only
10 members on the board), then a majority of the entire membership would be 6 members (more than half of 10), but a majority of
the fixed membership would still be 7 members.[18]

"MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT"
A "majority of the members present" means more than half of the members at the meeting.[18]  If 30 members were at a meeting, a
majority of the members present would be 16. In any situation which specifies such a requirement for a vote, an abstention would
have the same effect as a "no" vote.[4]

A vote of a "majority of the members present" is not the same as a "majority vote". When unqualified, a "majority vote" is taken
to mean more than half of the votes cast.[3]  If 30 members were at a meeting, but only 20 votes were cast, a majority vote would
be 11 votes.[18]

ERRONEOUS DEFINITIONS
Erroneous definitions of majority include "50% +1" and "51%".[2]

"50% + 1"
For example, say a board has 7 members. A majority would be 4 (more than half of 7). If "50% +1" is used, the number calculated
would be 4.5, and thus majority may be mistaken as 5.[2]  This confusion would exist for all odd numbers using the erroneous
definition of "50%+1".

"51%"
In another example, say a convention  has 1000 delegates. Using the erroneous definition of 51% would result in a majority being
mistaken as 510 instead of 501.

The same logic applies for 50.1%, 50.01%, 50.001%, etc.
