Map showing the countries of the world.A country  is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent 
sovereign state  or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign  or formerly sovereign political division, or a
geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people  with distinct political
characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the 
League of Nations  in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations  in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent
exercise of legal jurisdiction.

Sometimes the word countries  is used to refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,[1][2]  while other times
it refers only to states.[3]  For example, the CIA World Factbook  uses the word in its "Country name" field to refer to "a wide
variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities in addition to the traditional
countries or independent states".[4][Note 1]



ETYMOLOGY AND USAGE
The word country  comes from Old French  cuntrée, itself derived from Vulgar Latin  (terra) contrata  (“(land) lying opposite;
(land) spread before”), derived from contra  (“against, opposite”). It most likely entered the English language after the 
Franco-Norman invasion  during the 11th century.

In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the 
indefinite
article  – "a country" – through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a synonym  for state, or a former sovereign state, in the
sense of sovereign territory or "district, native land".[5]  Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such
as the West Country  in England, the Black Country  (a heavily industrialized part of England), "Constable Country" (a part of 
East Anglia  painted by John Constable), the "big country" (used in various contexts of the American West), "coal country" (used
of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.[6]

The equivalent terms in French and other Romance languages  (pays  and variants) have not carried the process of being identified
with political sovereign states as far as the English "country", instead derived from, pagus, which designated the territory
controlled by a medieval count, a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for
sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the German Bundesländer, as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state.
France has very many "pays" that are officially recognised at some level, and are either natural regions, like the Pays de Bray,
or reflect old political or economic entities, like the Pays de la Loire.

A version of "country" can be found in the modern French language  as contrée, based on the word cuntrée  in Old French,[6]  that
is used similarly to the word "pays" to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some
particular cases. The modern Italian contrada  is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a ward  or similar
small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.

SOVEREIGNTY STATUS
See also: List of sovereign statesThe term "country" is frequently used to refer to sovereign states. There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries"
in the world, since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status. There are 206 sovereign states, with 193 states
participating in the United Nations, two observer states (the Holy See  and Palestine), and 11 other states. All are defined as
states by declarative theory of statehood  and constitutive theory of statehood. The latest proclaimed state is South Sudan.

Although not sovereign states, England, Scotland, Wales  and Northern Ireland  can be referred to as separate countries, which
collectively form the sovereign state known as the United Kingdom.[7][8][9][10]  The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries
varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas dependencies  (such as the British
Virgin
Islands  in UK  and Saint Pierre and Miquelon  in France), with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own.
Such dependent territories are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries, but may nonetheless be treated
as a separate "country of origin" in international trade, as Hong Kong  is.[11][12][13]
