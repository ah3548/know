For other uses, see Council (disambiguation).Not to be confused with counsel.A council  is a group of people who come together to consult, deliberate, or make decisions. A council may function as a 
legislature, especially at a town, city  or county  level, but most legislative bodies at the state or national level are not
considered councils. At such levels, there may be no separate executive branch, and the council may effectively represent the
entire government. A board of directors  might also be denoted as a council. A committee  might also be denoted as a council,
though a committee is generally a subordinate body composed of members of a larger body, while a council may not be. Because many
schools have a student council, the council is the form of governance with which many people are likely to have their first
experience as electors or participants.

A member of a council may be referred to as a councillor  or councilperson, or by the gender-specific titles of councilman  and 
councilwoman.
