For other uses, see International (disambiguation).International  mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country. The term
international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond
national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country  and usually everywhere on Earth,
and international language  which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country.



ORIGIN OF THE WORD
The term international  was coined by the utilitarian  philosopher Jeremy Bentham  in his Introduction to Principles of Morals
and
Legislation, which was printed for publication in 1780 and published in 1789. Bentham wrote: "The word international, it must be
acknowledged, is a new one; though, it is hoped, sufficiently analogous and intelligible. It is calculated to express, in a more
significant way, the branch of law which goes commonly under the name of the law of nations.[1]  The word was adopted in French in
1801.[2]  Thomas Erskine Holland  noted in his article on Bentham in the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica  that "Many
of Bentham's phrases, such as 'international,' 'utilitarian,' 'codification,' are valuable additions to our language; but the
majority of them, especially those of Greek derivation, have taken no root in it."
